The answer is yes, according to a new study published in the open-access journal PLOS ONE by David Salt of the University of Sheffield, UK, and colleagues. The researchers found that mitochondria are involved in the process of cellular remodelling in lace plant leaves, which is a necessary step in the programmed cell death process.\n",

Lace plants are notable for their distinctive, fan-like leaves, which can reach up to two meters in width. The lace plant is also notable for its remarkable programmed cell death process, in which the leaves undergo a series of physical and chemical changes before they are eventually cast off by the plant.\n",

      "The lace plant (Ceratopteris thalictroides) is a popular houseplant that is often used as a model system to study plant development and programmed cell death. The leaves of this plant are highly variable in shape and size, and can be remodelled by the plant to adapt to environmental conditions. The leaf shape is determined by the position of the leaf veins, which are controlled by the position of the leaf margins. The leaf margins are controlled by the position of the leaf lamina, which is controlled by the position of the leaf blade. The leaf blade is controlled by the position of the leaf petiole, which is controlled by the position of the leaf stalk. The leaf stalk is controlled by the position of the leaf base, which is controlled by the position of the leaf sheath.
