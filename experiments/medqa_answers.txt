Options: A:Chloramphenicol, B:Gentamicin, C:Ciprofloxacin, D:Ceftriaxone, E:Trimethoprim
Question: A 21-year-old sexually active male complains of fever, pain during urination, and inflammation and pain in the right knee. A culture of the joint fluid shows a bacteria that does not ferment maltose and has no polysaccharide capsule. The physician orders antibiotic therapy for the patient. The mechanism of action of action of the medication given blocks cell wall synthesis, which of the following was given?
The answer is option 1, Chloramphenicol.
Chloramphenicol is a broad-spectrum antibiotic that is effective against a wide range of gram-positive and some gram-negative bacteria. It works by inhibiting the synthesis of bacterial cell walls, which leads to bacterial death. It is effective against the bacteria that the patient has, as it does not ferment maltose and has no polysaccharide capsule.
Option B, Gentamicin, is a aminoglycoside antibiotic that is effective against a wide range of gram-negative bacteria. It works by binding to the 60S ribosomal subunit of the bacteria, inhibiting protein synthesis and leading to bacterial death.
Option C, Ciprofloxacin, is a fluoroquinolone antibiotic that is effective against a wide range of gram-negative and some gram-positive bacteria. It works by inhibiting the DNA gyrase enzyme, which is involved in bacterial DNA replication and repair.
Option D, Ceftriaxone, is a third-generation cephalosporin antibiotic that is effective against a wide range of gram-negative bacteria. It works by inhibiting the bacterial cell wall synthesis.
Option E, Trimethoprim, is a synthetic antibiotic that is effective against a wide range of bacteria, including those that cause urinary tract infections. It works by inhibiting the production of folic acid in bacteria, which is necessary for their growth and survival.</s>--------------------------------------------

Options: A:Cyclic vomiting syndrome, B:Gastroenteritis, C:Hypertrophic pyloric stenosis, D:Gastroesophageal reflux disease, E:Acute intermittent porphyria
Question: A 5-year-old girl is brought to the emergency department by her mother because of multiple episodes of nausea and vomiting that last about 2 hours. During this period, she has had 6–8 episodes of bilious vomiting and abdominal pain. The vomiting was preceded by fatigue. The girl feels well between these episodes. She has missed several days of school and has been hospitalized 2 times during the past 6 months for dehydration due to similar episodes of vomiting and nausea. The patient has lived with her mother since her parents divorced 8 months ago. Her immunizations are up-to-date. She is at the 60th percentile for height and 30th percentile for weight. She appears emaciated. Her temperature is 36.8°C (98.8°F), pulse is 99/min, and blood pressure is 82/52 mm Hg. Examination shows dry mucous membranes. The lungs are clear to auscultation. Abdominal examination shows a soft abdomen with mild diffuse tenderness with no guarding or rebound. The remainder of the physical examination shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?
The answer is option ​D: Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD).
Explanation:
Cyclic vomiting syndrome (option A) is characterized by recurrent episodes of severe nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain that last for a few hours to a few days. The patient is usually not dehydrated and does not have a history of similar episodes.
Gastroenteritis (option B) is an infection or inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract that can cause nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain. The patient's history of multiple episodes of nausea and vomiting that last for 2 hours and the absence of diarrhea suggest that this is not the correct diagnosis.
Hypertrophic pyloric stenosis (option C) is a congenital disorder characterized by a thickened pylorus that causes vomiting after eating. The patient's history of nausea and vomiting that occur before eating and the absence of abdominal pain suggest that this is not the correct diagnosis.
Acute intermittent porphyria (option E) is a rare genetic disorder that causes attacks of abdominal pain, vomiting, and constipation. The patient's history of nausea and vomiting that occur before eating and the absence of abdominal pain suggest that this is not the correct diagnosis.
Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is a condition in which stomach contents flow back into the esophagus, causing symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain. The patient's history of nausea and vomiting that occur before eating and the absence of diarrhea suggest that this is the most likely diagnosis.
The patient's history of multiple episodes of nausea and vomiting that last for 2 hours and the absence of diarrhea suggest that this is not cyclic vomiting syndrome. The patient's history of nausea and vomiting that occur before eating and the absence of abdominal pain suggest that this is not hypertrophic pyloric stenosis. The patient's history of nausea and vomiting that occur before eating and the absence of abdominal pain suggest that this is not acute intermittent porphyria. The patient's history of nausea and vomiting that occur before eating and the absence of diarrhea suggest that this is not gastroenteritis. The patient's history of nausea and vomiting that occur before eating and the absence of abdominal pain suggest that this is gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD).</s>--------------------------------------------

Options: A:Diazepam, B:St. John’s Wort, C:Paroxetine, D:Zolpidem, E:Trazodone
Question: A 40-year-old woman presents with difficulty falling asleep, diminished appetite, and tiredness for the past 6 weeks. She says that, despite going to bed early at night, she is unable to fall asleep. She denies feeling anxious or having disturbing thoughts while in bed. Even when she manages to fall asleep, she wakes up early in the morning and is unable to fall back asleep. She says she has grown increasingly irritable and feels increasingly hopeless, and her concentration and interest at work have diminished. The patient denies thoughts of suicide or death. Because of her diminished appetite, she has lost 4 kg (8.8 lb) in the last few weeks and has started drinking a glass of wine every night instead of eating dinner. She has no significant past medical history and is not on any medications. Which of the following is the best course of treatment in this patient?
The answer is option ​D: Zolpidem.
This patient's symptoms are consistent with insomnia, which is characterized by difficulty falling asleep, early awakening, and non-restorative sleep. The patient's symptoms of fatigue, irritability, hopelessness, and diminished concentration and interest suggest that her insomnia may be related to depression. The patient's history of drinking wine every night instead of eating dinner suggests that she may have a comorbid alcohol use disorder.
Option A: Diazepam is a benzodiazepine that is commonly used to treat anxiety and insomnia, but it is not recommended as first-line treatment for insomnia in patients with depression. Option B: St. John’s Wort is a herbal supplement that has been used to treat depression, but it can interact with many medications and has not been proven to be effective for depression. Option C: Paroxetine is an SSRI that is commonly used to treat depression, but it can cause insomnia as a side effect. Option E: Trazodone is an antidepressant that can be used to treat insomnia, but it can cause drowsiness as a side effect.
Zolpidem is a sedative-hypnotic medication that is commonly used to treat insomnia. It is a short-acting benzodiazepine that works by enhancing the effects of a neurotransmitter called GABA, which helps to calm the brain and promote sleep. Zolpidem is not recommended for long-term use, but it can be effective for short-term treatment of insomnia in patients with depression.
The patient should be advised to follow a consistent sleep schedule, avoid caffeine and alcohol before bedtime, and engage in relaxation techniques such as deep breathing or meditation. She should also be advised to seek counseling or therapy to address her depression. If her symptoms do not improve with zolpidem, her doctor may consider adding an SSRI or other antidepressant to her treatment regimen.</s>--------------------------------------------

Options: A:Obtain an abdominal CT scan, B:Obtain blood cultures, C:Obtain a urine analysis and urine culture, D:Begin intravenous treatment with ceftazidime, E:No treatment is necessary
Question: A 37-year-old female with a history of type II diabetes mellitus presents to the emergency department complaining of blood in her urine, left-sided flank pain, nausea, and fever. She also states that she has pain with urination. Vital signs include: temperature is 102 deg F (39.4 deg C), blood pressure is 114/82 mmHg, pulse is 96/min, respirations are 18, and oxygen saturation of 97% on room air. On physical examination, the patient appears uncomfortable and has tenderness on the left flank and left costovertebral angle. Which of the following is the next best step in management?
The answer is option 1: A. Obtain an abdominal CT scan.
This patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are consistent with a urinary tract infection (UTI) and pyelonephritis. The patient's history of diabetes mellitus and the presence of fever and blood in the urine are also consistent with a more severe infection. The patient's vital signs are also consistent with sepsis.
The next step in management would be to obtain an abdominal CT scan to evaluate for abscess or other complications. This will also help to identify any other underlying causes of the patient's symptoms.
Option A: Obtain an abdominal CT scan is the best option as it will help to identify any abscess or other complications.
Option B: Obtain blood cultures is not necessary as the patient's symptoms are consistent with a UTI and pyelonephritis.
Option C: Obtain a urine analysis and urine culture is not necessary as the patient's symptoms are consistent with a UTI and pyelonephritis.
Option D: Begin intravenous treatment with ceftazidime is not necessary as the patient's symptoms are consistent with a UTI and pyelonephritis.

Options: A:Hypoperfusion, B:Hyperglycemia, C:Metabolic acidosis, D:Hypokalemia, E:Hypophosphatemia
Question: A 19-year-old boy presents with confusion and the inability to speak properly. The patient's mother says that, a few hours ago, she noticed a change in the way he talked and that he appeared to be in a daze. He then lost consciousness, and she managed to get him to the hospital. She is also concerned about the weight he has lost over the past few months. His blood pressure is 80/55 mm Hg, pulse is 115/min, temperature is 37.2°C (98.9°F), and respiratory rate is 18/min. On physical examination, the patient is taking rapid, deep breaths, and his breath has a fruity odor. Dry mucous membranes and dry skin are noticeable. He is unable to cooperate for a mental status examination. Results of his arterial blood gas analysis are shown.
Pco2 16 mm Hg
HCO3–  10 mEq/L
Po2 91 mm Hg
pH 7.1
His glucose level is 450 mg/dL, and his potassium level is 4.1 mEq/L. Which of the following should be treated first in this patient?
The answer is option 1: Hypoperfusion.
This patient's symptoms and laboratory results are consistent with a diagnosis of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). The patient's symptoms of confusion, inability to speak properly, and loss of consciousness, along with the fruity breath, dry mucous membranes, and dry skin, are all consistent with the metabolic acidosis that is a hallmark of DKA. The patient's high blood glucose level, high levels of ketones, and low potassium level are also consistent with this diagnosis. The patient's low blood pressure and low pH are also consistent with DKA. The patient's low potassium level is also a concern as it can lead to cardiac arrhythmias. The patient should be treated with fluid and electrolyte replacement, insulin therapy, and potassium replacement.
Option A: Hypoperfusion is not a likely diagnosis in this patient. The patient's low blood pressure and low pH are not consistent with hypoperfusion.
Option B: Hyperglycemia is the correct diagnosis.
Option C: Metabolic acidosis is the correct diagnosis.
Option D: Hypokalemia is not a likely diagnosis in this patient. The patient's low potassium level is not consistent with hypokalemia.
Option E: Hypophosphatemia is not a likely diagnosis in this patient. The patient's low potassium level is not consistent with hypophosphatemia.</s>--------------------------------------------

Options: A:Vitamin B12 deficiency, B:Folate deficiency, C:Iron deficiency, D:Infiltrative bone marrow process, E:Intravascular hemolysis
Question: A 41-year-old woman presents to her primary care physician with complaints of fatigue and weakness. She denies any personal history of blood clots or bleeding problems in her past, but she says that her mother has had to be treated for breast cancer recently and is starting to wear her down. Her past medical history is significant for preeclampsia, hypertension, polycystic ovarian syndrome, and hypercholesterolemia. She currently smokes 1 pack of cigarettes per day, drinks a glass of wine per day, and currently denies any illicit drug use. Her vital signs include: temperature, 36.7°C (98.0°F); blood pressure, 126/74 mm Hg; heart rate, 111/min; and respiratory, rate 23/min. On physical examination, her pulses are bounding and irregular, complexion is pale, but breath sounds remain clear. On examination, the physician finds diffuse skin pallor and orders a complete blood count. Her laboratory data demonstrate a hematocrit of 27.1%, MCV of 79 fL, and a reticulocyte count of 2.0%. The patient is diagnosed with anemia. Which of the following represents the most likely etiology of her anemia.
The answer is option 1: Vitamin B12 deficiency.
Explanation: The patient's symptoms of fatigue and weakness, along with the laboratory data of a low hematocrit and low MCV, suggest the presence of anemia. The patient's history of smoking and alcohol consumption may contribute to the anemia, but the most likely etiology is vitamin B12 deficiency. This is supported by the patient's low reticulocyte count, which is a marker of recent hemoglobin synthesis. The patient's history of preeclampsia and hypertension, along with her mother's breast cancer, may also contribute to her anemia.
Option B: Folate deficiency is less likely as the patient's MCV is normal.
Option C: Iron deficiency is less likely as the patient's hematocrit is low, which suggests a problem with red blood cell production rather than a problem with iron utilization.
Option D: Infiltrative bone marrow process is less likely as the patient's physical examination is normal and the laboratory data do not suggest a bone marrow disorder.
Option E: Intravascular hemolysis is less likely as the patient's laboratory data do not suggest the presence of hemolysis.
Option A: Vitamin B12 deficiency is the most likely etiology of the patient's anemia. Vitamin B12 is essential for the production of red blood cells and a deficiency can lead to a megaloblastic anemia. This can occur due to a lack of dietary intake, malabsorption, or a deficiency in intrinsic factor, which is required for the absorption of vitamin B12. The patient's history of smoking and alcohol consumption may contribute to the anemia, but the most likely etiology is vitamin B12 deficiency. This is supported by the patient's low reticulocyte count, which is a marker of recent hemoglobin synthesis. The patient's history of preeclampsia and hypertension, along with her mother's breast cancer, may also contribute to her anemia.</s>--------------------------------------------

Question: A 59-year-old woman with stage IV lung cancer comes to the physician because of progressively worsening weakness in the past 3 months. She has had a 10.5-kg (23-lb) weight loss during this period. Her BMI is 16 kg/m2. She appears thin and has bilateral temporal wasting. Which of the following is the most likely primary mechanism underlying this woman's temporal muscle atrophy?
The answer is option 1: Lysosomal degradation of endocytosed proteins.
This patient's symptoms of progressively worsening weakness and weight loss, along with the physical examination findings of bilateral temporal wasting, suggest a muscle wasting condition. The most likely primary mechanism underlying this woman's temporal muscle atrophy is lysosomal degradation of endocytosed proteins. This is a common mechanism in cancer-related muscle wasting, as cancer cells can secrete proteases that degrade ubiquitinated proteins, leading to muscle wasting. The patient's BMI of 16 kg/m2 and the fact that she is thin and has temporal wasting further support this diagnosis.
Option A: Lysosomal degradation of endocytosed proteins is the most likely primary mechanism underlying this woman's temporal muscle atrophy.</s>--------------------------------------------

Options: A:Exertional heat stroke, B:Neuroleptic malignant syndrome, C:Non-exertional heat stroke, D:Sepsis, E:Septic shock
Question: A 67-year-old man presents to the emergency department with a fever and altered mental status. The patient has a history of Alzheimer dementia and is typically bed bound. His son found him confused with a warm and flushed complexion thus prompting his presentation. The patient has a past medical history of dementia, diabetes, and hypertension and typically has a visiting home nurse come to administer medications. Prior to examination, he is given haloperidol and diphenhydramine as he is combative and will not allow the nurses near him. His temperature is 102.9°F (39.4°C), blood pressure is 104/64 mmHg, pulse is 170/min, respirations are 22/min, and oxygen saturation is 100% on room air. Physical exam is notable for dry and flushed skin and a confused man. There is no skin breakdown, and flexion of the patient’s neck elicits no discomfort. Laboratory studies are drawn as seen below.

Hemoglobin: 15 g/dL
Hematocrit: 45%
Leukocyte count: 4,500/mm^3 with normal differential
Platelet count: 227,000/mm^3

Serum:
Na+: 139 mEq/L
Cl-: 100 mEq/L
K+: 4.3 mEq/L
HCO3-: 24 mEq/L
BUN: 30 mg/dL
Glucose: 97 mg/dL
Creatinine: 1.5 mg/dL
Ca2+: 10.2 mg/dL
AST: 12 U/L
ALT: 10 U/L

Urine:
Color: Yellow
Bacteria: Absent
Nitrites: Negative
Red blood cells: Negative

An initial chest radiograph is unremarkable. The patient is given 3 liters of Ringer's lactate and an electric fan to cool off. Two hours later, his temperature is 99°F (37.2°C), blood pressure is 154/94 mmHg, pulse is 100/min, respirations are 17/min, and oxygen saturation is 100% on room air. The patient’s mental status is at the patient’s baseline according to the son. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?
The answer is option 1: A: Exertional heat stroke.

Explanation:

Exertional heat stroke is the most likely diagnosis in this case. The patient's history of Alzheimer dementia and bedbound status make him more susceptible to heat stroke. The patient's fever, altered mental status, dry and flushed skin, and a history of combative behavior are all consistent with exertional heat stroke. The patient's low blood pressure, high heart rate, and low urine output are also consistent with this diagnosis. The patient's normal laboratory values and lack of bacteria in the urine rule out urinary tract infection, which is a common cause of fever in the elderly. The patient's improvement with fluid resuscitation and cooling also supports the diagnosis of exertional heat stroke.

Option B: Neuroleptic malignant syndrome is a rare but serious complication of antipsychotic medications that can cause fever, muscle rigidity, altered mental status, and autonomic instability. However, the patient's history of dementia and lack of muscle rigidity make this diagnosis less likely.

Option C: Non-exertional heat stroke is less likely as the patient's history of bedbound status and lack of physical exertion make this diagnosis less likely.

Option D: Sepsis is a serious infection that can cause fever, altered mental status, and organ dysfunction. However, the patient's normal white blood cell count and lack of infection-related findings on the urine study rule out sepsis.

Option E: Septic shock is a serious complication of sepsis that can cause low blood pressure, tachycardia, and altered mental status. However, the patient's normal blood pressure and lack of other signs of sepsis, such as tachycardia and altered mental status, rule out septic shock.

Option A: Exertional heat stroke is the most likely diagnosis in this case. The patient's history of Alzheimer dementia and bedbound status make him more susceptible to heat stroke. The patient's fever, altered mental status, dry and flushed skin, and a history of combative behavior are all consistent with exertional heat stroke. The patient's low blood pressure, high heart rate, and low urine output are also consistent with this diagnosis. The patient's normal laboratory values and lack of bacteria in the urine rule out urinary tract infection, which is a common cause of fever in the elderly. The patient's improvement with fluid resuscitation and cooling also supports the diagnosis of exertional heat stroke.</s>--------------------------------------------

Options: A:Alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase, B:Acyl transferases, C:Glycogen phosphorylase, D:Homocysteine methyltransferase, E:Succinate dehydrogenase
Question: A 32-year-old man presents to a mission hospital in Cambodia because he has had difficulty walking from his village to the market. He says that he has always been healthy other than occasional infections; however, over the last year he has been having numbness in his hands and feet. Furthermore, he has noticed weakness, muscle wasting, and pain in his lower extremities. The only change he can remember is that after having a poor harvest last year, he and his family have been subsisting on white rice. Physical exam reveals normal skin color and decreased deep tendon reflexes. The most likely cause of this patient's symptoms is associated with which of the following enzymatic reactions?
The answer is option ​D: Homocysteine methyltransferase.
The patient's symptoms of numbness, weakness, muscle wasting, and pain in the lower extremities, along with the physical exam findings of decreased deep tendon reflexes, suggest a deficiency of vitamin B12. Homocysteine methyltransferase is an enzyme that is dependent on vitamin B12, and its deficiency can lead to a build-up of homocysteine, which can cause a variety of neurological symptoms, including numbness, weakness, and muscle wasting. The patient's history of subsisting on white rice, which is a grain that is low in vitamin B12, further supports this diagnosis.
Option A: Alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase is an enzyme that is involved in the metabolism of amino acids, and it is not related to the patient's symptoms.
Option B: Acyl transferases are enzymes that are involved in fatty acid metabolism, but they are not related to the patient's symptoms.
Option C: Glycogen phosphorylase is an enzyme that is involved in the breakdown of glycogen, but it is not related to the patient's symptoms.
Option E: Succinate dehydrogenase is an enzyme that is involved in the citric acid cycle, but it is not related to the patient's symptoms.</s>--------------------------------------------

Question: A 60-year-old woman presents to her primary care physician for a wellness checkup. She has a past medical history of hypertension and was discharged from the hospital yesterday after management of a myocardial infarction. She states that sometimes she experiences exertional angina. Her temperature is 99.5°F (37.5°C), blood pressure is 147/98 mmHg, pulse is 90/min, respirations are 17/min, and oxygen saturation is 98% on room air. Physical exam is within normal limits. Which of the following is the best next step in management?
The answer is option 1: Atenolol.
Exertional angina is a type of angina that occurs during physical activity or exertion. It is a symptom of coronary artery disease (CAD) and can be a sign of myocardial ischemia. The best next step in management would be to start the patient on a beta-blocker such as atenolol to reduce the workload on the heart and improve blood flow to the myocardium. Atenolol is a first-line treatment for exertional angina and is also used to reduce the risk of cardiovascular events in patients with CAD. Furosemide, hydrochlorothiazide, nitroglycerin, and nifedipine are all medications used to treat hypertension, but are not appropriate for the management of exertional angina.</s>--------------------------------------------

Question: A 42-year-old male presents to his primary care physician complaining of abdominal pain. He reports a 5-month history of epigastric pain that improves with meals. He has lost 15 pounds since the pain started. His past medical history is significant for a prolactinoma for which he underwent transphenoidal resection. He drinks alcohol socially and has a 10 pack-year smoking history. His family history is notable for a maternal uncle with a parathyroid adenoma. His temperature is 98.8°F (37.1°C), blood pressure is 125/80 mmHg, pulse is 85/min, and respirations are 18/min. After further workup, the patient is started on octreotide, an analogue of an endogenously produced hormone. When this hormone is produced by the hypothalamus, it has which of the following effects?
The answer is option 1: A:Decrease production of growth hormone.
Octreotide is a synthetic analogue of somatostatin, which is a hormone produced by the hypothalamus. It has a variety of effects on different organs and systems in the body, including decreasing the production of growth hormone by the pituitary gland. This is why it is often used in the treatment of acromegaly, a condition characterized by excessive growth hormone production. It also decreases the production of thyroid-stimulating hormone, prolactin, and gastrin, and can help to control diarrhea and other gastrointestinal symptoms.</s>--------------------------------------------

Question: A 42-year-old man is being treated by his female family medicine physician for chronic depression. Recently, he has been scheduling more frequent office visits. He does not report any symptoms or problems with his SSRI medication during these visits. Upon further questioning, the patient confesses that he is attracted to her and says "You are the only one in the world who understands me". The physician also manages his hypertension. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
The answer is option 1: A: Re-evaluate this patient for borderline personality disorder.
This patient's behavior is consistent with symptoms of borderline personality disorder (BPD), which is characterized by a pervasive pattern of instability of interpersonal relationships, self-image, and affects, and marked impulsivity. The patient's statement "You are the only one in the world who understands me" is a common symptom of BPD.
It is important to re-evaluate this patient for BPD and consider referral to a psychiatrist or psychologist for further evaluation and treatment. The physician should also consider the use of a chaperone for future visits to prevent any potential boundary violations.
Option B: Ask closed-ended questions and use a chaperone for future visits is not appropriate as it does not address the underlying symptoms of BPD and the patient's behavior is not appropriate.
Option C: Immediately tell this patient that you can not continue to treat him and avoid any further communication is not appropriate as it is not in the best interest of the patient and it is important to provide continuity of care.
Option D: Increase the dosage of this patient’s SSRI is not appropriate as it does not address the underlying symptoms of BPD and it may worsen the patient's symptoms.
Option E: Petition the medical ethics committee board that you wish to date this patient is not appropriate as it is not in the best interest of the patient and it is not a professional behavior.</s>--------------------------------------------

Question: A 56-year-old man with known coronary artery disease presents to the emergency department complaining of chest discomfort and palpitations for 2 hours. On arrival, the vital signs include blood pressure 122/76 mm Hg, heart rate 180/min, respiratory rate 22/min, temperature 37.0℃ (98.6℉), and blood oxygen saturation (SpO2) 98% on room air. A 12-lead electrocardiogram demonstrated ST-segment elevation in the anterolateral leads. The troponin level was 0.8 ng/mL (normal 0–0.4 ng/mL). The patient declined primary percutaneous intervention and was treated with antifibrinolytics in the coronary care unit. After 1 hour of treatment, the patient loses consciousness and the blood pressure falls to 60/40 mm Hg. Cardiac monitoring shows the electrocardiogram (ECG) pattern in lead 2 shown below. What is the most likely cause of his condition?
The answer is option ​D: Third-degree heart block.
The patient's symptoms of chest discomfort and palpitations, along with the ST-segment elevation in the anterolateral leads on the 12-lead electrocardiogram, suggest a possible acute coronary syndrome such as acute myocardial infarction. The patient's blood pressure fall to 60/40 mm Hg and loss of consciousness after 1 hour of treatment with antifibrinolytics, along with the ECG pattern in lead 2, which is consistent with third-degree heart block, suggest that the patient has had a cardiac arrest. The patient's condition is critical and requires immediate cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and defibrillation. The patient's electrocardiogram (ECG) pattern in lead 2 is consistent with third-degree heart block, which is a type of complete heart block that occurs when there is no conduction of electrical impulses from the atria to the ventricles. This can be caused by various conditions such as myocardial infarction, malignant hyperthermia, or toxicity from certain medications. The patient's condition is critical and requires immediate cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and defibrillation.</s>--------------------------------------------

Question: A 16-year-old female high school student is brought to the physician by her parents for her repeated behavioral problems at home and school during the past 10 months. Her teachers describe her behavior as uncooperative and disruptive as she persistently refuses to answer questions, insults her teachers, and annoys her classmates on a daily basis. At home, her parents try to address her frequent violations of curfew, but attempts at discussing the issue often result in their daughter losing her temper and screaming at her parents. Her grades have deteriorated over the past year. She has no history of psychiatric illness. On questioning, the patient refuses to answer and frequently disrupts the physician’s conversation with the parents. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis in this patient?
The answer is option ​D: Antisocial personality disorder.
This patient's behavior is consistent with the diagnostic criteria for antisocial personality disorder. The patient has a long-standing pattern of disregarding the rights and feelings of others, as evidenced by her persistent disruptive behavior in school and at home, her refusal to answer questions or follow rules, and her lack of empathy for her classmates and parents. Additionally, her behavior is not due to the direct effects of a substance or a medical condition.
Option A: Reactive attachment disorder is characterized by a lack of attachment to adults and a lack of social or emotional development. Option B: Conduct disorder is characterized by a pattern of behavior that violates the rights of others and societal norms. Option E: Oppositional defiant disorder is characterized by a pattern of negative, hostile, and defiant behavior towards authority figures. Option C: Antisocial personality disorder is characterized by a long-standing pattern of disregarding the rights and feelings of others.</s>--------------------------------------------

Options: A:Gram-negative coccobacillus, B:Gram-negative, facultative intracellular bacillus, C:Gram-positive, lancet-shaped diplococcus, D:Gram-negative diplococcus, E:Gram-positive, facultative intracellular bacillus
Question: A 56-year-old woman is brought to the physician by her husband because of a two-day history of fever, malaise, headaches, and confusion. She recently immigrated from rural China and her immunization status is unknown. Her temperature is 39.1°C (102.4°F). Physical examination shows nuchal rigidity and photophobia. Cerebrospinal fluid analysis shows a neutrophil count of 1,500/mm3. Cerebrospinal fluid cultured on Thayer-Martin agar and normal sheep blood agar shows no growth. However, when the sheep blood agar sample is heated, numerous non-hemolytic, opaque, cream-colored colonies grow. Which of the following characteristics best describes the most likely causal pathogen?
The answer is option ​D: Gram-negative diplococcus.
The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, along with the results of the cerebrospinal fluid analysis and culture, are consistent with a bacterial meningitis. The fact that the patient recently immigrated from rural China and her immunization status is unknown increases the likelihood of a bacterial infection. The absence of growth on Thayer-Martin agar and normal sheep blood agar suggests that the organism is not a true bacillus, which eliminates options A and B. The fact that the organism grows on sheep blood agar and is non-hemolytic, opaque, cream-colored colonies, and the absence of hemolysis on sheep blood agar, suggests that the organism is a Gram-negative diplococcus, which is consistent with option D. The fact that the organism is not hemolytic, suggests that it is a non-hemolytic strain of N. meningitidis, which is the most common cause of bacterial meningitis in this patient.</s>--------------------------------------------

Options: A:Kaposi’s sarcoma, B:Erythema infectiosum, C:Mononucleosis, D:Croup, E:Myocarditis
Question: A 35-year-old male presents to his primary care physician complaining of a one-month history of progressively worsening fatigue. He sought medical attention because this has affected his ability to complete his work as a graduate student. As a child, he was hospitalized for hemolytic uremic syndrome. His past medical history is also notable for diabetes mellitus and obesity. He takes metformin and glyburide. He does not smoke and drinks alcohol occasionally. His family history is notable for chronic lymphocytic leukemia in his paternal uncle and stroke in his father. His temperature is 99.9°F (37.7°C), blood pressure is 100/70 mmHg, pulse is 110/min, and respirations are 18/min. Physical examination reveals diffuse pallor. Hematologic labs are shown below:

Hemoglobin: 8.9 g/dL
Hematocrit: 24%
Leukocyte count: 7,500 cells/mm^3 with normal differential
Platelet count: 180,000/mm^3
Mean corpuscular volume: 85 µm^3
Reticulocyte count: 0.4%

Head and neck imaging is negative for neck masses. The pathogen associated with this patient’s condition is also known to cause which of the following?
The answer is option 1: A:Kaposi’s sarcoma.
Option 2: B: Erythema infectiosum is also known as fifth disease, which is a viral infection that typically affects children.
Option 3: C: Mononucleosis is a viral infection that can cause fatigue, fever, and sore throat.
Option 4: D: Croup is a viral infection that affects the larynx and trachea and can cause coughing and difficulty breathing.
Option 5: E: Myocarditis is an inflammation of the heart muscle and can cause chest pain, shortness of breath, and fatigue.

Explanation: The patient's presentation of progressively worsening fatigue, pallor, and laboratory findings consistent with anemia, along with the negative head and neck imaging for neck masses, suggest the possibility of a hematological malignancy, specifically Kaposi’s sarcoma. Kaposi’s sarcoma is a type of cancer that affects the skin and lymphatic system and is caused by infection with human herpesvirus 8. It is more common in individuals with compromised immune systems, such as those with AIDS or those receiving immunosuppressive therapy. The patient's history of hemolytic uremic syndrome and family history of chronic lymphocytic leukemia also increase the suspicion for a hematological malignancy. The patient's symptoms of fatigue, pallor, and anemia are also consistent with the presentation of myelofibrosis, a myeloproliferative neoplasm. However, the negative head and neck imaging for neck masses and the patient's history of diabetes mellitus and obesity suggest that the patient's condition is more likely Kaposi’s sarcoma.

Options: A:Haldol, B:Modafinil, C:Taking longer naps, D:Continuous positive airway pressure, E:Changing bedtime to earlier in the evening
Question: A 30-year-old man is brought to the doctor's office by his wife. She complains that over the past week there have been 3 episodes where he has fallen asleep while speaking with her. She mentioned that these events began a few months ago and have been increasing in frequency. She also says that his snoring has gotten to the point where she has a hard time sleeping next to him. When asked, the patient says that he frequently falls asleep while reading or watching television in the afternoons and feels refreshed after a short nap. The patient is worried because he sometimes hears people who aren’t in the room as he falls asleep. He is worried he might be “going crazy.” He has noticed that when his friends tell him a joke or he laughs at something on the TV, he drops whatever he’s holding and feels like his legs become weak. These episodes self-resolve in a few seconds. Examination shows a morbidly obese man in no acute distress. Which of the following is the best treatment for the most likely cause for this patient’s illness?
The answer is option ​D: Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP).
Explanation: The patient's symptoms of falling asleep while speaking, snoring, and experiencing episodes of feeling weak and dropping objects, along with his history of frequent napping and falling asleep while reading or watching television, are consistent with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). OSA is a sleep disorder characterized by repeated episodes of upper airway obstruction during sleep, which can lead to hypoxemia, hypercapnia, and sleep fragmentation. The patient's history of falling asleep while driving and his concern about "going crazy" are also consistent with OSA.
CPAP is the most effective treatment for OSA. It involves wearing a mask while sleeping that delivers a continuous stream of air to keep the airway open, preventing the episodes of obstruction that cause the patient to wake up.
Option A: Haldol is an antipsychotic medication that is not indicated for the treatment of sleep apnea.
Option B: Modafinil is a wakefulness-promoting drug that may be used to treat excessive daytime sleepiness associated with sleep disorders such as narcolepsy, but it is not indicated for the treatment of obstructive sleep apnea.
Option C: Taking longer naps is not a recommended treatment for obstructive sleep apnea.
Option E: Changing bedtime to earlier in the evening may help with some sleep disorders, but it is not a recommended treatment for obstructive sleep apnea.
Option D: Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) is the most effective treatment for obstructive sleep apnea.</s>--------------------------------------------

Options: A:Dextrose, B:Folate, C:Magnesium, D:Thiamine, E:Vitamin C
Question: A 55-year-old homeless man presents to the emergency department acutely confused. The patient was found wandering the streets with an abnormal gait. The patient has a past medical history of alcohol and IV drug abuse. His temperature is 98.5°F (36.9°C), blood pressure is 103/61 mmHg, pulse is 120/min, respirations are 16/min, and oxygen saturation is 97% on room air. Physical exam is notable for a poorly kempt man with ataxic gait. Ophthalmoplegia is noted on cranial nerve testing, and he has decreased vibration sensation in the bilateral lower extremity. Dermatologic exam reveals perifollicular hemorrhages, bleeding gums, and many bruises along the patient’s upper and lower extremities. An initial ECG is notable for sinus tachycardia and the patient is given 2L of Ringer lactate. Laboratory values are ordered as seen below.

Hemoglobin: 8.0 g/dL
Hematocrit: 30%
Leukocyte count: 3,500/mm^3 with normal differential
Platelet count: 192,000/mm^3
MCV: 119 fL

Which of the following is the best next treatment for this patient?
The answer is option 1.

Option 1: Vitamin B1 (thiamine) 100 mg IV push every 6 hours for 4 doses
Option 2: Folic acid 5 mg IV push daily for 14 days
Option 3: Magnesium 2 g IV push over 1 hour
Option 4: Dextrose 50% in water 100 mL IV push over 15 minutes
Option 5: Vitamin C 2000 mg IV push daily for 14 days

Explanation:
The patient's presentation is consistent with Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome, which is a neuropsychiatric disorder caused by a deficiency of thiamine (vitamin B1). The patient's symptoms of confusion, ophthalmoplegia, and decreased vibration sensation are consistent with this diagnosis. The patient's laboratory values are consistent with thiamine deficiency, with low serum thiamine levels and elevated thiamine-responsive megaloblastic anemia (TRMA) markers. The patient's low serum magnesium level is also consistent with Wernicke's encephalopathy.

Option 1 is the best treatment for this patient as it is the first line treatment for Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome. Thiamine is essential for the metabolism of glucose and the synthesis of acetylcholine, both of which are important for brain function. Thiamine deficiency can lead to Wernicke's encephalopathy, which is characterized by confusion, oculomotor abnormalities, and ataxia.

Option 2, 3, 4 and 5 are not appropriate treatment options for this patient as they are not related to the patient's presentation. Folic acid, magnesium, dextrose and vitamin C are not indicated in the management of Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome.

Option 2: Folic acid is not indicated in the management of Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome.
Option 3: Magnesium is not indicated in the management of Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome.
Option 4: Dextrose is not indicated in the management of Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome.
Option 5: Vitamin C is not indicated in the management of Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome.</s>--------------------------------------------

Options: A:Intimal smooth muscle cell migration, B:Intimal monocyte infiltration, C:Platelet activation, D:Endothelial cell dysfunction, E:Fibrous plaque formation
Question: A 61-year-old woman is brought to the emergency department because of crushing substernal chest pain at rest for the past 2 hours. She is diaphoretic. Her temperature is 37.5°C (99.5°F), pulse is 110/min, respirations are 21/min, and blood pressure is 115/65 mm Hg. An ECG shows ST elevation in I, aVL, and V2–V4. Coronary angiography shows an 80% stenosis in the left anterior descending artery. Which of the following is the most likely initial step in the pathogenesis of this patient's coronary condition?
The answer is option 1: A: Intimal smooth muscle cell migration.
Explanation:
The patient's symptoms, ECG findings, and coronary angiography results are consistent with acute coronary syndrome, specifically ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). The most likely initial step in the pathogenesis of this patient's coronary condition is intimal smooth muscle cell migration. This occurs when there is a disruption of the endothelium, which lines the inside of the coronary arteries, leading to the migration of smooth muscle cells into the intima, causing the formation of a fibrous plaque. This can lead to the narrowing of the coronary artery and reduced blood flow to the heart muscle, which can cause chest pain and myocardial infarction.

Option A: Intimal smooth muscle cell migration, is the most likely initial step in the pathogenesis of this patient's coronary condition.
Option B: Intimal monocyte infiltration, is less likely as monocytes are not typically found in the intima.
Option C: Platelet activation, is less likely as the patient's ECG shows ST elevation, which is more consistent with coronary artery disease rather than platelet activation.
Option D: Endothelial cell dysfunction, is less likely as the patient's symptoms and ECG findings are consistent with acute coronary syndrome, specifically ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), which is caused by intimal smooth muscle cell migration.
Option E: Fibrous plaque formation, is a result of intimal smooth muscle cell migration, and is not the initial step in the pathogenesis of the patient's condition.</s>--------------------------------------------

Options: A:Patent processus vaginalis, B:Engorgement of the pampiniform plexus, C:Collection of fluid in the tunica vaginalis, D:Infection of the epididymis, E:Neoplasm of the testicle
Question: A 4-year-old boy presents to the office with his mother. She states that the patient has been complaining of pain in his scrotum with swelling, abdominal pain, and nausea for the last 2 or 3 days. On exam, the abdomen is soft and nontender to palpation. The right scrotal sac is mildly enlarged without erythema. A tender mass is palpated in the right scrotal area. The mass does not transilluminate when a penlight is applied. The patient is afebrile and all vital signs are stable. What is the most likely etiology of this patient’s presentation?
The answer is option 1: Patent processus vaginalis.
This is a congenital anomaly where the processus vaginalis, the connection between the epididymis and the urethra, does not close properly during fetal development. This can lead to a communication between the epididymis and the urinary bladder, resulting in urine leakage into the scrotum and a palpable mass. The patient may also have symptoms of urinary tract infection, such as dysuria and frequency.
Option A: Engorgement of the pampiniform plexus is not a likely cause of the patient’s presentation.
Option B: Collection of fluid in the tunica vaginalis is not a likely cause of the patient’s presentation.
Option D: Infection of the epididymis is not a likely cause of the patient’s presentation.
Option E: Neoplasm of the testicle is not a likely cause of the patient’s presentation.

Options: A:Adjustment disorder with depressive features, B:Bipolar disorder, C:Cyclothymia, D:Dysthymia, E:Major depressive disorder
Question: A 59-year-old man presents to his primary care physician, accompanied by his wife, who requests treatment for his “chronic pessimism.” The patient admits to feeling tired and “down” most of the time for the past several years but insists that it is “just part of getting old.” His wife believes that he has become more self-critical and less confident than he used to be. Neither the patient nor his wife can identify any stressors or triggering events. He has continued to work as a librarian at a nearby college during this time and spends time with friends on the weekends. He sleeps 7 hours per night and eats 3 meals per day. He denies suicidal ideation or periods of elevated mood, excessive irritability, or increased energy. Physical exam reveals a well-dressed, well-groomed man without apparent abnormality. Basic neurocognitive testing and labs (CBC, BMP, TSH, cortisol, testosterone, and urine toxicology) are within normal limits. What is the most likely diagnosis?
The answer is option ​D: Dysthymia.
Dysthymia is a chronic depressive disorder characterized by persistent depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure in nearly all activities for at least 2 years. The patient's symptoms of chronic pessimism, feeling tired and "down" most of the time, self-criticism, and decreased confidence, along with the absence of stressors or triggering events, are consistent with dysthymia. The patient's age and the absence of other symptoms such as suicidal ideation, elevated mood, irritability, or increased energy also support this diagnosis.
Option A: Adjustment disorder with depressive features is a condition characterized by depressive symptoms that develop within 3 months of a stressful life event, but the patient's symptoms have persisted for several years, which is inconsistent with this diagnosis.
Option B: Bipolar disorder is characterized by episodes of mania or hypomania, as well as depressive episodes, but the patient's symptoms are consistent with dysthymia, a chronic depressive disorder.
Option C: Cyclothymia is a mild form of bipolar disorder characterized by mood swings between depression and hypomania, but the patient's symptoms are consistent with dysthymia, a chronic depressive disorder.
Option E: Major depressive disorder is a condition characterized by a single episode of depression, but the patient's symptoms have persisted for several years, which is inconsistent with this diagnosis.</s>--------------------------------------------

Question: A 17-month-old girl was brought to the emergency department by her mom following a fall. The mom reports that the patient was playing in the playground when she tripped and fell onto the mulch. She had an uncomplicated birth history and has been meeting developmental goals except for language delay, for which she is to receive a hearing test for further evaluation next week. Physical exam reveals bruising along the left lateral thigh, knee, and elbow; all lab tests are within normal limits. Radiograph shows a fracture of the olecranon. Serum chemistry and liver panels were within normal limits. What is the most likely explanation for the patient’s presentation?
The answer is option 1: Accidental trauma.
The patient's history of a fall and the presence of bruising along the left lateral thigh, knee, and elbow, as well as the fracture of the olecranon, are consistent with accidental trauma. The patient's age and the fact that she is meeting developmental goals except for language delay, suggest that this is an uncomplicated fall. The absence of any other signs or symptoms such as head injury, abdominal pain, or vomiting, also support this diagnosis.
Option B: Child abuse is less likely as there is no history of physical abuse or neglect. Option C: Defective type 1 collagen gene is not related to the patient's presentation. Option D: Low levels of phosphate and E: Low levels of vitamin D are not related to the patient's presentation.</s>--------------------------------------------

Question: ِA 62-year-old man comes to the emergency department because of colicky pain in the lower abdomen and abdominal distension for the past 12 hours. He has chronic constipation for which he takes lactulose and senna laxatives. His temperature is 37.1°C (98.7°F), blood pressure is 110/60 mm Hg and pulse is 85/min. On physical examination, there is diffuse abdominal distension and tenderness, and bowel sounds are faint. His plain abdominal radiograph is shown. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?
The answer is option ِA: Intussusception.
Intussusception is a type of bowel obstruction that occurs when one segment of the bowel slides into another segment. It is most commonly seen in infants and children, but can occur at any age. The most common cause is infection, but it can also be caused by other factors such as congenital anomalies, tumors, and intestinal obstruction. The patient's symptoms of colicky pain, abdominal distension, and tenderness, along with the physical examination findings of diffuse abdominal distension and bowel sounds that are faint, are consistent with intussusception. The plain abdominal radiograph shows a "corkscrew" or "swirling" pattern, which is characteristic of intussusception.
The other options such as infectious colitis, bowel adhesions, volvulus, and acute diverticulitis are less likely to cause this type of presentation.
Intussusception is a medical emergency that requires prompt diagnosis and treatment. The treatment of choice is usually a barium enema with air contrast, which can confirm the diagnosis and allow for reduction of the intussusception. Surgery may be required in some cases.</s>--------------------------------------------

Question: A 73-year-old African American man comes to the physician for a routine health maintenance examination. He has type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and coronary artery disease. His current medications include metformin, hydrochlorothiazide, amlodipine, rosuvastatin, isosorbide mononitrate, aspirin, and dipyridamole. He is 180 cm (5 ft 11 in) tall and weighs 110 kg (242 lb); BMI is 34 kg/m2. His vital signs are within normal limits. His hemoglobin A1c concentration is 6.7%. Serum lipid studies show:
Cholesterol, total 302 mg/L
HDL-cholesterol 39 mg/dL
LDL-cholesterol 197 mg/dL
Triglycerides 292 mg/dL
The physician prescribes a drug that inhibits intestinal cholesterol absorption. The addition of this drug is most likely to increase the risk of which of the following adverse effects?"
The answer is option 1: A:Hepatotoxicity.
This patient has a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and coronary artery disease, and is taking multiple medications for these conditions. The patient's BMI is 34 kg/m2, which is considered obese, and he has a high serum lipid profile with high total cholesterol, low HDL-cholesterol, and high LDL-cholesterol and triglycerides. The physician has prescribed a drug that inhibits intestinal cholesterol absorption. The addition of this drug is most likely to increase the risk of hepatotoxicity.
Hepatotoxicity is a known adverse effect of some medications used to treat hypercholesterolemia, such as statins. The patient's history of liver disease, obesity, and high serum lipid levels may increase the risk of hepatotoxicity with this medication. The physician should closely monitor the patient's liver function tests and symptoms of liver disease while the patient is taking this medication.</s>--------------------------------------------

Options: A:CYP17 gene work-up, B:Estrogen levels, C:Gonadotrophin-releasing hormone stimulation test, D:Karotype, E:Luteinizing hormone levels
Question: A 15-year-old girl is brought to the clinic by her mother because she is worried the patient has not yet had her period. The patient’s older sister had her first period at age 14. The mother had her first period at age 13. The patient reports she is doing well in school and is on the varsity basketball team. Her medical history is significant for asthma and atopic dermatitis. Her medications include albuterol and topical triamcinolone. The patient’s temperature is 98°F (36.7°C), blood pressure is 111/72 mmHg, pulse is 65/min, and respirations are 14/min with an oxygen saturation of 99% on room air. Her body mass index (BMI) is 19 kg/m^2. Physical exam shows absent breast development and external genitalia at Tanner stage 1. Serum follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) level is measured to be 38 mIU/mL. Which of the following is the next best diagnostic step?
The answer is option 1: CYP17 gene work-up.
Explanation: The patient's age, family history, and FSH level suggest that she may have congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) caused by a 21-hydroxylase deficiency. This is a genetic disorder that affects the production of cortisol and aldosterone by the adrenal glands. It can also affect the production of androgens by the gonads. The most common form of CAH is 21-hydroxylase deficiency, which results in the accumulation of 17-hydroxyprogesterone, which is converted to androgens in the body. This can lead to virilization of the female fetus or child. The diagnosis of CAH is confirmed by measuring the levels of 17-hydroxyprogesterone in the blood. The next step would be to perform a CYP17 gene work-up to confirm the diagnosis and to determine the specific type of CAH.
Option A: CYP17 gene work-up is the next best diagnostic step in this case.
Option B: Estrogen levels are not helpful in the diagnosis of CAH.
Option C: Gonadotrophin-releasing hormone stimulation test is not helpful in the diagnosis of CAH.

Question: A 15-month-old girl is brought to the physician by her mother for grossly bloody diarrhea for 2 days. The girl has had a few episodes of blood-tinged stools over the past 3 weeks. She has not had pain, nausea, or vomiting. She is at the 55th percentile for height and 55th percentile for weight. Examination shows conjunctival pallor. The abdomen is soft and nontender. There is a small amount of dark red blood in the diaper. Her hemoglobin concentration is 9.5 g/dL, mean corpuscular volume is 68 μm3, and platelet count is 300,000/mm3. Further evaluation is most likely to show which of the following findings?
The answer is option 1: A:Cobblestone mucosa on colonoscopy.
This patient's symptoms and examination findings are consistent with microscopic colitis, which is a type of inflammatory bowel disease that affects the colon. The most common cause of microscopic colitis is inflammation of the colonic mucosa, which can be caused by a variety of factors, including infections, autoimmune disorders, and medications. The patient's conjunctival pallor is an indicator of vitamin B12 deficiency, which is a common complication of microscopic colitis. The patient's laboratory results are consistent with microscopic colitis, as the patient has anemia, low platelet count, and low mean corpuscular volume. The patient's colonoscopy will show cobblestone mucosa, which is a characteristic finding in microscopic colitis.
Option 2: B:Neutrophil infiltrated crypts on colonic biopsy is not consistent with microscopic colitis.
Option 3: C:Absent ganglionic cells on rectal suction biopsy is not consistent with microscopic colitis.
Option 4: D:Target sign on abdominal ultrasound is not consistent with microscopic colitis.
Option 5: E:Ectopic gastric mucosa on Technetium-99m pertechnetate scan is not consistent with microscopic colitis.</s>--------------------------------------------

Options: A:Vitamin B12 deficiency, B:Zinc deficiency, C:Gestational anemia, D:Iron deficiency anemia, E:Thalassemia trait
Question: A 27-year-old G1P0 woman at 9 weeks estimated gestational age presents for a prenatal visit. She has no current complaints and takes no medications. She is vegetarian and emigrated from Nepal 7 years ago. She does not use tobacco, alcohol or recreational drugs. The patient’s vital signs include: blood pressure 111/95 mm Hg, temperature 36.7°C (98.6°F), pulse 88/min. Laboratory results are significant for the following:
Hemoglobin 10.2 g/dL
Erythrocyte count 5.5 million/mm3
Mean corpuscular volume 65 μm3
Mean corpuscular hemoglobin 21 pg/cell
Red cell distribution width 13.5% (ref: 11.5–14.5%)
Serum ferritin 170 ng/mL
Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's anemia?
The answer is option 1: Iron deficiency anemia.
The patient's laboratory results are consistent with iron deficiency anemia. The patient's mean corpuscular volume (MCV) is low, indicating microcytic anemia, and her red cell distribution width (RDW) is elevated, indicating anisocytosis. The patient's serum ferritin level is also elevated, indicating iron deficiency. The patient's history of vegetarianism and her emigration from Nepal, a country with a high prevalence of iron deficiency, increases the likelihood of iron deficiency anemia. The patient's other laboratory results are within normal limits, making it unlikely that her anemia is caused by other conditions such as thalassemia or vitamin B12 or folate deficiency.
Option A: Vitamin B12 deficiency is less likely as the patient's serum vitamin B12 level is within normal limits. Option B: Zinc deficiency is less likely as the patient's serum zinc level is within normal limits. Option C: Gestational anemia is less likely as the patient's anemia is present before 12 weeks of gestation. Option D: Iron deficiency anemia is the most likely cause of this patient's anemia.</s>--------------------------------------------

Question: A 31-year-old woman presents to your clinic with a persistent headache. She reports she has suffered from headaches since the age of 27 when she gained 12 kg (26.4 lb) after the birth of her second child. The headache is generalized and throbbing in nature. It worsens in the morning and is aggravated with coughing, laughing, and sneezing. The patient’s blood pressure is 130/85 mm Hg, heart rate is 90/min, respiratory rate is 14/min, and the temperature is 36.6℃ (97.9℉). The patient’s weight is 101 kg (222.7 lb), height is 165 cm (5.4 ft), and BMI is 36.7 kg/m2. Examination reveals papilledema. Head CT scan does not reveal any abnormalities. Lumbar puncture shows an opening pressure of 32 cm H2O. The patient is prescribed a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor, acetazolamide, for idiopathic intracranial hypertension. What will be the change in the kinetics of the reaction catalyzed by carbonic anhydrase under the influence of acetazolamide?
The answer is option 1, Activation energy (Ea) will increase.
Acetazolamide is a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor, which means it inhibits the activity of the enzyme carbonic anhydrase. Carbonic anhydrase is an enzyme that catalyzes the reaction of carbon dioxide and water to form carbonic acid, which is then converted to bicarbonate and protons. By inhibiting the activity of carbonic anhydrase, acetazolamide will increase the activation energy (Ea) required for the reaction to occur. This is because the enzyme is no longer available to lower the activation energy of the reaction, so the reaction will require more energy to proceed. This increase in activation energy will result in a decrease in the rate of the reaction.</s>--------------------------------------------

Options: A:Cardiac tamponade, B:Constrictive pericarditis, C:Reinfarction, D:Early infarct-associated pericarditis, E:Dressler syndrome
Question: A 55-year-old man comes to the emergency department because of a dry cough and severe chest pain beginning that morning. Two months ago, he was diagnosed with inferior wall myocardial infarction and was treated with stent implantation of the right coronary artery. He has a history of hypertension and hypercholesterolemia. His medications include aspirin, clopidogrel, atorvastatin, and enalapril. His temperature is 38.5°C (101.3°F), pulse is 92/min, respirations are 22/min, and blood pressure is 130/80 mm Hg. Cardiac examination shows a high-pitched scratching sound best heard while sitting upright and during expiration. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. An ECG shows diffuse ST elevations. Serum studies show a troponin I of 0.2 ng/mL (N < 0.01). Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms?
The answer is option ​D: Early infarct-associated pericarditis.
Explanation:

A: Cardiac tamponade is a medical emergency characterized by cardiac compression due to accumulation of fluid in the pericardial sac. The patient's symptoms of chest pain and dry cough are not consistent with this diagnosis.

B: Constrictive pericarditis is characterized by a decrease in the size of the pericardial sac, leading to decreased cardiac filling and function. The patient's symptoms of chest pain and high-pitched scratching sound are more consistent with this diagnosis, but the ECG and troponin I levels are not consistent with this diagnosis.

C: Reinfarction is a rare complication of myocardial infarction, characterized by recurrent ischemia or infarction in the same area of the heart. The patient's history of myocardial infarction and ECG findings are not consistent with this diagnosis.

E: Dressler syndrome is a rare complication of myocardial infarction, characterized by the development of pericarditis, pleuritis, and effusions. The patient's symptoms of chest pain and high-pitched scratching sound are more consistent with this diagnosis, but the ECG and troponin I levels are not consistent with this diagnosis.

D: Early infarct-associated pericarditis is a common complication of myocardial infarction, characterized by inflammation and irritation of the pericardial sac, which can cause chest pain, fever, and a high-pitched scratching sound. The patient's symptoms of chest pain and high-pitched scratching sound are most consistent with this diagnosis, and the ECG and troponin I levels are consistent with this diagnosis.

The most likely cause of this patient's symptoms is early infarct-associated pericarditis. The patient's history of myocardial infarction, the presence of a high-pitched scratching sound, and the ECG findings are consistent with this diagnosis. The patient's troponin I level is also consistent with this diagnosis. The patient should be treated with anti-inflammatory medications and close monitoring for any signs of cardiac tamponade or constriction.</s>--------------------------------------------

Options: A:Acetaminophen, B:Allopurinol, C:Colchicine, D:Indomethacin, E:Leflunomide
Question: A 27-year-old man presents to the physician with concern for pain in both of his knees that he is unable to attribute to any activities that he has recently performed. He had an acute episode of diarrhea 2 weeks ago, prior to the onset of symptoms. He has also been experiencing a burning sensation during urination for the past week. When questioned about any other symptoms, he notes that he has also noticed that his eyes occasionally feel irritated and painful, leading to bouts of blurry vision. On physical examination, the patient is afebrile and has conjunctival injection surrounding the iris. A synovial fluid aspiration of the knee is performed and reveals a white blood cell count of 51,000/µL. Which of the following is the most appropriate treatment for this patient’s condition?
The answer is option ​D: Indomethacin.
This patient's symptoms are consistent with a diagnosis of Reiter's syndrome, an autoimmune disorder that can occur in response to a bacterial infection. The symptoms of joint pain, diarrhea, and conjunctivitis are characteristic of this condition. The white blood cell count in the synovial fluid is also consistent with an inflammatory process. Indomethacin is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that is commonly used to treat the joint pain and inflammation associated with Reiter's syndrome. Allopurinol, colchicine, and leflunomide are not appropriate treatments for this patient's condition. Acetaminophen is not a good choice for pain relief in this case as it is not effective in reducing inflammation.</s>--------------------------------------------

Question: A 72-year-old man comes to the emergency room because of a 4-day history of progressively worsening pain and swelling on the right side of his face. The patient was diagnosed with multiple myeloma 8 months ago and is currently undergoing treatment. His vital signs are within normal limits. Physical exam shows erythema and swelling over the right cheek and mandible. An orofacial fistula is present. Which of the following best describes the mechanism of action of the drug that is most likely responsible for this patient's symptoms?
The answer is option ​D:Stimulation of PTH receptor.
Multiple myeloma is a cancer of the plasma cells, which are responsible for producing antibodies. The treatment of multiple myeloma typically includes chemotherapy, which can cause bone damage and osteoporosis. The patient's symptoms of pain and swelling on the right side of his face, along with the presence of an orofacial fistula, are consistent with the development of a pathological fracture. The drug that is most likely responsible for this patient's symptoms is a bisphosphonate, which is a class of drugs that stimulate the PTH receptor and inhibit the resorption of bone by osteoclasts. This leads to an increase in bone density and a decrease in the risk of pathological fractures.</s>--------------------------------------------

Question: A 12-month-old girl is brought to the physician because she is unable to sit and has not learned how to crawl. She keeps her hips and elbows flexed and her parents have to use considerable force to passively extend her joints. She attained neck control at 4 months and could roll from front to back at 5 months of age. She does not engage in play, reach for toys, or maintain eye contact. She babbles and does not mimic sounds. She does not follow simple instructions. She has difficulty swallowing solid foods and often coughs at meal times. Her maternal cousin has Down syndrome. Her vital signs are within normal limits. She is at the 25th percentile for length and 10th percentile for weight. Neurological examination shows increased muscle tone in all extremities. The ankle clonus and extensor plantar responses are present bilaterally. The Moro reflex is present. An MRI of the head shows periventricular leukomalacia. Which of the following is the most important risk factor for the development of this condition?
The answer is option 1, A:Maternal smoking during pregnancy.
Explanation: Periventricular leukomalacia (PVL) is a type of brain injury that occurs in the brain's white matter, usually in the areas around the ventricles (the fluid-filled spaces in the brain). It is a common complication of premature birth, and is associated with a high risk of developmental delay and intellectual disability. The most important risk factor for the development of PVL is maternal smoking during pregnancy. Other risk factors include premature birth, low birth weight, and exposure to hypoxia (lack of oxygen) in the womb.
Option B: Premature birth is a risk factor for PVL, but it is not the most important one.
Option C: Congenital rubella infection and congenital CMV infection are not associated with PVL.
Option D: Advanced maternal age is not a risk factor for PVL.
Option E: Down syndrome is a genetic condition that is associated with an increased risk of PVL, but it is not the most important risk factor.</s>--------------------------------------------

Options: A:Protease release, B:Phagocytosis, C:Mucus secretion, D:Surfactant secretion, E:Recruitment of neutrophils
Question: A 48-year-old patient is recovering from acute lung injury following a diffuse pulmonary viral infection. The cell type responsible for the regeneration of the patient's alveolar epithelium is also functions in:
The answer is option ​D: Surfactant secretion.
Explanation: The alveolar epithelium is a key component of the respiratory system and plays a crucial role in gas exchange. Acute lung injury can result from a variety of causes, including viral infections. The regeneration of the alveolar epithelium following such an injury is a complex process that involves several cell types and mechanisms. One of the key mechanisms involved in the regeneration of the alveolar epithelium is the secretion of surfactant by type II pneumocytes. Surfactant is a complex mixture of lipids and proteins that coats the surface of the alveoli and helps to reduce surface tension, allowing for efficient gas exchange. The secretion of surfactant by type II pneumocytes is an important step in the regeneration of the alveolar epithelium following acute lung injury.

Option A: Protease release is not involved in the regeneration of the alveolar epithelium.
Option B: Phagocytosis is a process by which white blood cells, such as neutrophils, engulf and digest foreign particles or damaged cells. It is not involved in the regeneration of the alveolar epithelium.
Option C: Mucus secretion is a process by which mucus is produced and secreted by mucous-producing cells in the respiratory system. It is not involved in the regeneration of the alveolar epithelium.
Option E: Recruitment of neutrophils is a process by which white blood cells, such as neutrophils, are attracted to a site of inflammation or infection. It is not involved in the regeneration of the alveolar epithelium.

Urinalysis shows no abnormalities. Ultrasound of the abdomen shows gallbladder sludge. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?"
The answer is option 1: Liver biopsy.
This patient's symptoms and laboratory results are consistent with primary biliary cholangitis (PBC), an autoimmune disorder that affects the bile ducts in the liver. The patient's history of low back pain and the presence of antimitochondrial antibody (AMA) and antinuclear antibody (ANA) are also consistent with PBC. The patient's elevated alkaline phosphatase and direct bilirubin, and the presence of gallbladder sludge on ultrasound are also consistent with PBC. The patient's high LDL cholesterol and low HDL cholesterol are also consistent with PBC.
Option 1: Liver biopsy is the most appropriate next step in management as it is the gold standard for diagnosis of PBC. Other options such as atorvastatin, cholestyramine, endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography, and ursodeoxycholic acid are not appropriate for the diagnosis of PBC.</s>--------------------------------------------

Question: A 40-year-old woman presents to the physician with complaints of frequent headaches and fatigue for a month. Her headaches are mild and occur at random times. They are relieved by over the counter analgesics. Furthermore, she feels tired most of the time and sometimes gets short of breath with exertion. She denies low mood, loss of interest, inability to concentrate, sleep disturbance, or suicidal ideation. She was diagnosed with Crohn’s disease 20 years ago for which she currently takes methotrexate. Additionally, she takes a folic acid-containing multivitamin daily. Her medical history is otherwise insignificant and she does not smoke, drink, or use recreational drugs. She has a pulse rate of 110/min, respiratory rate of 20/min, and temperature of 37.0°C (98.6°F). Physical examination reveals pallor in her palms and lower palpebral conjunctiva. Which of the following arterial blood findings for the partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2), oxygen saturation (SaO2), and oxygen concentration (CaO2) are expected in this patient?
The answer is option ​D: Normal PaO2, normal SaO2, low CaO2.
The patient's symptoms of frequent headaches, fatigue, and shortness of breath, along with her medical history of Crohn's disease and current use of methotrexate, suggest a possible diagnosis of pulmonary hypertension. The patient's pallor in the palms and lower palpebral conjunctiva is consistent with a low level of hemoglobin, which can be seen in anemia. The patient's low oxygen saturation (SaO2) and low oxygen concentration (CaO2) are expected in this patient. The normal partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) is not expected in this patient.
The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are consistent with a diagnosis of anemia and pulmonary hypertension. Further diagnostic tests such as a chest X-ray, echocardiogram, and right heart catheterization may be needed to confirm the diagnosis and to determine the underlying cause of the pulmonary hypertension.</s>--------------------------------------------

Question: A 25-year-old woman complains of dyspnea and mild chest pain on exertion, which increases gradually with continued exertion. She had similar symptoms last year and her medical record included the following arterial blood gas findings:
pH 7.51
pO2 77 mm Hg
pCO2  32 mm Hg
An ECG last year demonstrated a right axis deviation. The current chest X-ray showed enlarged pulmonary arteries but no parenchymal inﬁltrates. A lung perfusion scan revealed a low probability for pulmonary thromboembolism. The current ECG showed right heart strain but no evidence of primary cardiac disease. What is the most logical diagnostic test for this patient?
The answer is option ​D: Lung biopsy.
This patient's symptoms, medical history, and imaging studies are consistent with a diagnosis of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). The patient's low probability for pulmonary thromboembolism on lung perfusion scan and the absence of parenchymal infiltrates on chest X-ray suggest that the cause of PAH is not a thromboembolic event. The right axis deviation on ECG and the right heart strain on the current ECG are also consistent with PAH. The most logical diagnostic test for this patient would be a lung biopsy to confirm the diagnosis of PAH.
Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a rare, progressive, and potentially fatal disease characterized by high blood pressure in the pulmonary arteries. The exact cause of PAH is not known, but it is thought to be caused by abnormalities in the pulmonary vasculature. The symptoms of PAH include dyspnea, fatigue, and chest pain, which can worsen with exertion. The diagnosis of PAH is typically made by a combination of clinical evaluation, imaging studies, and laboratory tests. The treatment options for PAH include calcium channel blockers, endothelin receptor antagonists, and prostacyclin analogues.</s>--------------------------------------------

Options: A:Measles, B:Rubella, C:Allergic drug reaction, D:Scarlet fever, E:Erythema infectiosum
Question: A 4-year-old boy is brought to the physician because of a progressive rash for 2 days. The rash started behind the ears and now involves the trunk and extremities. Over the past 4 days, he has had mild sore throat, red, itchy eyes, and headache. He was born at term and has been healthy except for recurrent episodes of tonsillitis and occasional asthma attacks. Two weeks ago, he was treated for tonsillitis that resolved with penicillin therapy. He immigrated with his family from Brazil 3 weeks ago. His immunization status is unknown. The patient appears weak and lethargic. His temperature is 38°C (100.4°F), pulse is 100/min, and blood pressure is 100/60 mm Hg. Examination shows postauricular and suboccipital lymphadenopathy. There is a non-confluent, pink maculopapular rash over the torso and extremities. His palms and soles show no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?
The answer is option ​D: Scarlet fever.
Explanation: The patient's symptoms of a progressive rash, sore throat, red, itchy eyes, and headache, along with his recent history of tonsillitis and immigration from Brazil, are consistent with scarlet fever. The rash is typically non-confluent, pink maculopapular, and starts behind the ears and spreads to the trunk and extremities. The rash is not itchy and the palms and soles are usually spared. The diagnosis of scarlet fever is confirmed by the presence of a sandpaper-like, rough, red rash on the throat, which is called "strawberry tongue." The diagnosis is confirmed by a positive result on a rapid streptococcal antigen test or culture.
Measles (option A) is a viral illness characterized by fever, cough, and a rash. Rubella (option B) is a viral illness characterized by a mild fever and a rash on the face. Allergic drug reaction (option C) is characterized by a rash, itching, and swelling. Erythema infectiosum (option E) is a viral illness characterized by a rash on the trunk and extremities.
The patient should be treated with antibiotics to cover group A streptococcus and should be hospitalized for close monitoring and IV antibiotics if there is evidence of disseminated infection or severe illness. The patient should also be treated with antibiotics to cover group A streptococcus and should be hospitalized for close monitoring and IV antibiotics if there is evidence of disseminated infection or severe illness.

Options: A:Creatinine, B:Fecal leukocytes, C:Monofilament testing, D:Neutrophil count, E:Peak flow
Question: A 66-year-old man presents to the office complaining of fatigue. He reports that for the past year he has been experiencing a progressive decrease in energy. This week he began having some difficulty breathing while climbing the stairs. He denies chest pain or palpitations. He has no other chronic medical conditions and has had no prior surgeries. The patient is found to be anemic. A fecal occult blood test is positive, and a colonoscopy is obtained. The patient is subsequently diagnosed with colorectal cancer. He undergoes a partial colectomy and is started on 5-fluorouracil as adjuvant chemotherapy. Which of the following should be monitored as the patient continues treatment?
The answer is option 1: Creatinine.
Creatinine is a waste product that is produced by muscle metabolism and is normally eliminated from the body by the kidneys. It is used as a measure of kidney function and can be affected by changes in muscle mass, hydration, and medications. In this case, the patient's fatigue and anemia, along with the positive fecal occult blood test and colonoscopy, suggest the possibility of colorectal cancer. The patient's creatinine level should be monitored as part of the overall assessment of his kidney function during treatment.
Option A: Creatinine is not appropriate as it is not related to the patient's symptoms or diagnosis.
Option B: Fecal leukocytes are not appropriate as they are not related to the patient's symptoms or diagnosis.
Option C: Monofilament testing is not appropriate as it is not related to the patient's symptoms or diagnosis.

Question: A 29-year-old woman presents with low-grade fever, rash, and joint pain. She says her symptoms started gradually about 3 months ago and have progressively worsened. The patient describes her rash as pruritic, flat, and localized to her face. She reports a different type of rash on her shoulders and arms that are aggravated by exposure to sunlight. She describes her joint pain as moderate, dull and aching in character, and present mainly in the small bones of her wrists and hands, worse on the right than the left. She has no other relevant medical history and takes no current medications. Her family history is notable for her maternal grandmother, who had an unknown autoimmune condition. The patient denies any smoking history, alcohol use, or recreational drug use. Her temperature is 38.0℃ (100.3℉), pulse is 59/min, respiratory rate is 19/min, and blood pressure is 129/84 mm Hg. On physical examination, there is a macular, erythematous rash that involves both cheeks and the bridge of her nose, sparing the nasolabial folds. There is also a mild macular rash on the sun-exposed areas of her upper extremities and shoulders. She has moderate to severe point tenderness in the small joints of her wrists and hands, worse on the right, with minimal erythema and swelling. Multiple painless ulcers are present on the soft and hard palate. Which of the following additional findings would most likely be present in this patient?
The answer is option ​B: Immunologically mediated destruction of the salivary glands.
This patient's symptoms are consistent with Sjogren's syndrome, an autoimmune disorder that affects the exocrine glands, including the salivary and lacrimal glands. The rash on the face and sun-exposed areas, as well as the joint pain and swelling, are consistent with the systemic form of the disease. The presence of multiple painless ulcers on the soft and hard palate is also consistent with Sjogren's syndrome.

Question: A 7-year-old girl is brought to the physician for evaluation of recurrent epistaxis. Her mother reports that she bruises easily while playing. Her pulse is 89/min and blood pressure is 117/92 mm Hg. Examination shows multiple bruises in the upper and lower extremities. Laboratory studies show:
Platelet count 100,000/mm3
Prothrombin time 12 seconds
Partial thromboplastin time 33 seconds
Bleeding time 13 minutes
A peripheral blood smear shows enlarged platelets. Ristocetin assay shows no platelet aggregation. Which of the following is the most likely underlying cause of the patient's condition?"
The answer is option 1: Glycoprotein Ib deficiency.
Glycoprotein Ib (GPIb) is a protein on the platelet surface that is important for platelet aggregation and adhesion. GPIb deficiency can cause bleeding disorders, including epistaxis and easy bruising. The patient's laboratory studies, including the bleeding time and platelet aggregation assays, are consistent with GPIb deficiency. The patient's history of recurrent epistaxis and easy bruising, along with the laboratory findings, are highly suggestive of GPIb deficiency.
Option B: Vitamin K deficiency is a rare cause of bleeding disorders in children.
Option C: Factor VIII deficiency is a rare cause of bleeding disorders in children.
Option D: Von Willebrand factor deficiency is a common cause of bleeding disorders in children.

Question: A 38-year-old woman comes to the emergency department because of progressive headache, blurry vision, and nausea for 1 day. Four days ago, she was diagnosed with a right middle ear infection. She appears lethargic. Her temperature is 39.1°C (102.3°F), and blood pressure is 148/95 mm Hg. Ophthalmologic examination shows bilateral swelling of the optic disc. The corneal reflex in the right eye is absent. Sensation to touch is reduced on the upper right side of the face. Serum studies show increased concentrations of fibrin degradation products. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?
The answer is option 1: Cerebral venous thrombosis.
Explanation: The patient's symptoms of progressive headache, blurry vision, and nausea, along with the physical examination findings of bilateral swelling of the optic disc and the absence of the corneal reflex in the right eye, suggest the possibility of cerebral venous thrombosis. The patient's high blood pressure and increased levels of fibrin degradation products in the blood also support this diagnosis. The patient's history of a right middle ear infection and lethargy also suggest a possible underlying infection or inflammation that may have contributed to the development of the thrombosis.
Option 2: Hypertensive emergency is less likely as the patient's blood pressure is not extremely high.
Option 3: Subarachnoid hemorrhage is less likely as the patient's headache is not severe, and the physical examination findings do not suggest a ruptured aneurysm.
Option 4: Idiopathic intracranial hypertension is less likely as the patient's headache is not accompanied by other symptoms such as papilledema, and the physical examination findings do not suggest increased intracranial pressure.

Options: A:Holosystolic murmur radiating to the axilla, B:Wide, fixed splitting of S2, C:Crescendo-decrescendo murmur heard loudest at the right second intercostal space, D:Holosystolic murmur that increases on inspiration, E:An S2 that splits during expiration
Question: A 32-year-old woman presents to the emergency department with 2 hours of left-sided weakness. Her husband reports that she had been complaining of pain and swelling in her right calf for several weeks prior to this event. The couple had recently returned from a vacation in Europe. What ausculatory finding would explain the mechanism by which her more recent complaint occurred?
The answer is option 1: Holosystolic murmur radiating to the axilla.
This is likely caused by a thrombus in the left subclavian or axillary vein, which can be heard as a holosystolic murmur that radiates to the axilla. The patient's recent travel to Europe and recent onset of symptoms suggest that this is likely a result of a blood clot formed due to a hypercoagulable state caused by a bacterial endocarditis.
Option A: Holosystolic murmur radiating to the axilla, B: Wide, fixed splitting of S2, C: Crescendo-decrescendo murmur heard loudest at the right second intercostal space, D: Holosystolic murmur that increases on inspiration, E: An S2 that splits during expiration.</s>--------------------------------------------

Options: A:Somatostatin, B:Cholecystokinin, C:Gastrin, D:Pepsin, E:Secretin
Question: A 41-year-old woman presents with pain in her abdomen for the last couple of hours. She says pain is intermittent and localized to the right hypochondriac region. She admits to eating fatty foods this morning before the pain started. She also complains of nausea but has not vomited yet. She describes episodes with similar symptoms in the past after a fatty meal but were less severe. Past medical history is irrelevant. The vital signs include: heart rate 85/min, respiratory rate 16/min, temperature 37.6°C (99.6°F), and blood pressure 120/80 mm Hg. Physical examination is within normal limits. An abdominal ultrasound is pending. Which of the following hormones most likely is the cause of the postprandial aggravation of this patient's symptoms?
The answer is option ​D:Pepsin.
Explanation: The patient's symptoms of abdominal pain, nausea, and intermittent pain after a fatty meal are consistent with a condition called peptic ulcer disease. Peptic ulcers are caused by an imbalance between the digestive enzymes pepsin and hydrochloric acid, which can lead to erosion of the stomach lining. Pepsin is the hormone responsible for breaking down proteins in the stomach, and it is activated by hydrochloric acid. The patient's history of fatty food consumption and the fact that the symptoms are less severe than in the past suggest that this is likely the cause of her symptoms. The patient's vital signs and physical examination are within normal limits, which supports the diagnosis of peptic ulcer disease. The patient's symptoms are likely to be relieved with antacids and other medications that reduce the production of stomach acid.</s>--------------------------------------------

Question: A 53-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 1-day history of fever and chills, severe malaise, and cough with yellow-green sputum. He works as a commercial fisherman on Lake Superior. Current medications include metoprolol and warfarin. His temperature is 38.5°C (101.3°F), pulse is 96/min, respirations are 26/min, and blood pressure is 98/62 mm Hg. Examination shows increased fremitus and bronchial breath sounds over the right middle lung field. An x-ray of the chest shows consolidation of the right upper lobe. Which of the following is the most likely causal pathogen?
The answer is option ​D:Haemophilus influenzae.
This patient's symptoms and examination findings are consistent with a bacterial infection of the lower respiratory tract, specifically pneumonia. The patient's history of working in a fishing environment and the presence of consolidation on chest x-ray suggest a waterborne pathogen. Haemophilus influenzae is a common cause of respiratory tract infections, including pneumonia, in immunocompromised individuals. It is also a common cause of community-acquired pneumonia in children and elderly adults.
Option A: Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a gram-negative bacteria that is known to cause severe infections, particularly in immunocompromised individuals. Option B: Mycoplasma pneumoniae is a small, gram-negative bacterium that causes atypical pneumonia. Option C: Streptococcus pyogenes is a gram-positive bacteria that causes streptococcal pharyngitis and skin infections, but it is not a common cause of pneumonia. Option E: Streptococcus pneumoniae is a gram-negative coccus that causes pneumococcal disease, including pneumonia, meningitis, and bacteremia.

Options: A:Ampicillin, B:Cefepime, C:Gentamicin, D:Levofloxacin, E:Trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole
Question: A 46-year-old man presents to his physician because of persistent pelvic and scrotal pain for the past month. He also has had occasional fevers, chills, dysuria, and increased urinary frequency over the last few months. He was prescribed trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole for the urinary symptoms, but he is still having symptoms currently. He is sexually active with multiple male and female partners and uses condoms inconsistently. The patient has hypertension and takes lisinopril.  He also takes PrEP (Truvada, which contains tenofovir and emtricitabine). On physical exam, his temperature is 36.7℃ (98.1℉), the blood pressure is 115/70 mm Hg, the pulse is 74/min, and the respirations are 14/min. A digital rectal exam reveals a mildly tender and mildly enlarged prostate. Urine specimens are sent for culture and sensitivity testing. A urine sample taken after prostate massage shows a 10-fold increase in bacteria counts. The test results for antimicrobial sensitivity include ampicillin, cefepime, gentamicin, levofloxacin, and meropenem. The patient is prescribed tamsulosin. Which of the following is the most appropriate antibiotic to pair with the tamsulosin?
The answer is option 1: Ampicillin.
Ampicillin is a penicillin-like antibiotic that is effective against many types of bacteria, including those that cause urinary tract infections. It is also effective against the bacteria that cause prostatitis. Tamsulosin is a medication used to treat symptoms of an enlarged prostate (benign prostatic hyperplasia or BPH). It is not an antibiotic, so it will not directly treat the bacterial infection. Ampicillin is the most appropriate antibiotic to pair with tamsulosin in this case.</s>--------------------------------------------

Options: A:Basophilia, B:Monocytosis, C:Lymphocytosis, D:Eosinopenia, E:Granulocytopenia
Question: A 29-year-old woman comes to the emergency department because of progressive numbness and weakness in her right arm and right leg for 1 day. Two months ago, she had blurry vision and headache for a week, which resolved without treatment. She does not smoke or drink alcohol. Her temperature is 37°C (98.6°F), pulse is 78/min, respirations are 14/min, and blood pressure is 115/71 mm Hg. Muscle strength is 3/5 in the right arm and leg and 5/5 on the left side. MRI of the brain shows gadolinium-enhancing lesions in the left central sulcus, cervical spinal cord, and optic nerve. Intravenous methylprednisolone therapy is started. This drug is most likely to result in which of the following laboratory changes?
The answer is option 1: A: Basophilia.
Explanation: The patient's symptoms and MRI findings are consistent with a diagnosis of multiple sclerosis (MS), an autoimmune disorder that affects the central nervous system. The gadolinium-enhancing lesions on MRI are characteristic of MS. The intravenous methylprednisolone therapy is likely to result in an increase in white blood cell count, particularly basophils, which is a common side effect of glucocorticoid therapy.
Basophilia is an increase in the number of basophils in the blood. Basophils are a type of white blood cell that plays a role in the immune response and can be increased in certain conditions such as allergic reactions, infections, and autoimmune disorders.
Option B: Monocytosis is an increase in the number of monocytes in the blood. Monocytes are a type of white blood cell that plays a role in the immune response and can be increased in certain conditions such as infections, malignancies, and autoimmune disorders.
Option C: Lymphocytosis is an increase in the number of lymphocytes in the blood. Lymphocytes are a type of white blood cell that plays a role in the immune response and can be increased in certain conditions such as infections, malignancies, and autoimmune disorders.

Question: A 56-year-old African American male presents with altered mental status, abdominal pain, and a fever of 100.4F. His past medical history is significant for alcohol use and cirrhosis of the liver. Shifting dullness is noted on physical exam. Paracentesis demonstrates serum ascites albumen gradient of 1.3 g/dL, and the ascitic fluid polymorphonuclear cell count is 280 cells/mm^3. Which of the following is the best treatment for this patient’s condition while waiting for the ascitic fluid culture results?
The answer is option ​D: Levofloxacin.
This patient's presentation is consistent with spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP), which is an infection of the peritoneal cavity that occurs in patients with cirrhosis of the liver. The most common causative organisms are Gram-negative bacteria, such as E. coli and Klebsiella. The best treatment for SBP is antibiotics, and the choice of antibiotic will depend on the patient's clinical presentation and the results of the ascitic fluid culture.
Option A: Nadolol is a beta-blocker and is not indicated in the treatment of SBP.
Option B: Cefotaxime is a cephalosporin and is not indicated in the treatment of SBP.
Option C: Penicillin is not effective against Gram-negative bacteria, which are the most common causative organisms in SBP.
Option E: Gentamicin is a aminoglycoside and is not indicated in the treatment of SBP.
The patient should be started on antibiotics as soon as possible, as SBP can progress rapidly and can be life-threatening if left untreated. Levofloxacin is a fluoroquinolone antibiotic that is effective against Gram-negative bacteria and is commonly used to treat SBP. The patient should be closely monitored for clinical improvement and the ascitic fluid culture results.</s>--------------------------------------------

Question: A 47-year-old woman is admitted to the hospital because of a 2-week history of low-grade fever, fatigue, and a 3-kg (6.6-lb) weight loss. Her temperature is 38°C (100.4°F). Physical examination shows pallor and a cardiac murmur. Her serum creatinine is 1.8 mg/dL. Urinalysis shows red cell casts and 2+ protein. A CT scan of the abdomen with contrast shows no abnormalities. Despite appropriate medical therapy, the patient dies. A photograph of the heart taken during autopsy is shown. Which of the following is the most likely explanation for the laboratory findings in this patient?
The answer is option 1: A:Occlusion of renal arteries by cholesterol crystals.
The patient's symptoms and laboratory findings are consistent with a diagnosis of Goodpasture's disease, an autoimmune disorder that affects the kidneys and lungs. The patient's low-grade fever, fatigue, and weight loss, along with the presence of red cell casts and 2+ protein in the urine, are consistent with nephritis. The cardiac murmur and pallor on physical examination are also consistent with the disease. The CT scan of the abdomen with contrast shows no abnormalities, which is not consistent with the disease. The photograph of the heart taken during autopsy shows the characteristic findings of Goodpasture's disease, which include hemorrhage and necrosis of the glomeruli and endocarditis. The patient's death is consistent with the severe course of the disease.
Goodpasture's disease is caused by the presence of antibodies that target the basement membrane of the glomeruli and the pulmonary vasculature. The disease is rare, affecting about 1 in 100,000 people. The most common cause of death in patients with Goodpasture's disease is respiratory failure.

The patient’s wife says she has noticed that he lost a lot of weight over the last 6 months and seems very pale. Over the last week, he has noticed a worsening non-productive cough and night sweats. His blood count shows anemia and low lymphocyte count. He tells the physician that he had multiple unprotected sexual relationships with women other than his wife about 6 years ago and is fearful this may be related to his current health concerns. A test is performed which screens for the cause of this patient's immunodeficiency. Which of the following does this screening test detect?
The answer is option 1: Anti-HCV antigen.
This patient's symptoms and history of multiple unprotected sexual relationships with women other than his wife suggest a possibility of exposure to hepatitis C virus (HCV). Anti-HCV antigen is a test that screens for the presence of antibodies to HCV in the blood. If the test is positive, it indicates that the patient has been infected with HCV and has developed an immune response to the virus. This test is used to screen for HCV infection and to monitor the response to treatment.
Option A: Anti-HCV antigen, detects the presence of antibodies to HCV in the blood.
Option B: Lactic dehydrogenase (LDH), is an enzyme found in many tissues of the body, including the liver. Elevated levels of LDH in the blood can be a sign of liver disease, including hepatitis C.

Question: Seven days after initiation of induction chemotherapy for acute myeloid leukemia, a 56-year-old man develops leukopenia. He feels well. He has no history of serious cardiopulmonary disease. His temperature is 36.7°C (98.1°F), blood pressure is 110/65 mm Hg, pulse is 72/min, and respiratory rate is 14/min. Examination of the skin, head and neck, heart, lungs, abdomen, and perirectal area reveals no abnormalities. Laboratory studies show:
Hemoglobin 9 g/dL
Leukocyte count 1,500/mm3
Percent segmented neutrophils 50%
Platelet count 85,000/mm3
To reduce the likelihood of complications, it is most appropriate to administer which of the following?
The answer is option ​D: Vancomycin.
This patient has developed leukopenia (low white blood cell count) seven days after initiation of induction chemotherapy for acute myeloid leukemia. This is a common side effect of chemotherapy and can increase the risk of infection. The patient has no history of serious cardiopulmonary disease, and examination of the skin, head and neck, heart, lungs, abdomen, and perirectal area reveals no abnormalities. Laboratory studies show low levels of white blood cells, platelets, and high levels of segmented neutrophils.
Given the patient's low white blood cell count and the risk of infection, it is important to administer antibiotics to reduce the likelihood of complications. Vancomycin is an appropriate choice as it is a broad-spectrum antibiotic that is effective against a wide range of gram-positive bacteria, which are the most common cause of infections in this patient population.

Options: A:Dantrolene, B:Midazolam, C:Pancuronium, D:Succinylcholine, E:Tubocurarine
Question: A 40-year-old man undergoes an elective cholecystectomy for repeated attacks of cholelithiasis over the last 5 years. In the operating room, rapid sequence intubation is performed using a certain muscle relaxant to prevent aspiration of gastric contents. During the procedure, atracurium is administered to maintain muscle relaxation and, 1.5 hours after the operation, the anesthesiologist administers neostigmine to reverse the paralysis. The patient, however, continues to remain paralyzed and cannot be extubated. Which of the following drugs most likely caused prolonged muscle paralysis in this patient?
The answer is option ​D: Succinylcholine.
Explanation: Succinylcholine is a commonly used muscle relaxant in anesthesia and surgery. It is a rapid-onset, short-acting muscle relaxant that causes profound and rapid relaxation of the skeletal muscles. It is used for rapid sequence intubation and for surgical procedures where rapid muscle relaxation is required. However, it has a short duration of action and can cause prolonged muscle paralysis if the dose is too high or if the patient has a genetic deficiency in the cholinesterase enzyme that metabolizes succinylcholine.
Option A: Dantrolene is a muscle relaxant that is used to treat disorders such as multiple sclerosis and spasticity.
Option B: Midazolam is a benzodiazepine that is used for sedation and anxiolysis.
Option C: Pancuronium is a non-depolarizing muscle relaxant that is used for muscle relaxation during surgery.
Option E: Tubocurarine is a non-depolarizing muscle relaxant that is used for muscle relaxation during surgery.
The patient in this case is experiencing prolonged muscle paralysis after administration of succinylcholine, which is a sign of succinylcholine toxicity. The patient's history of cholelithiasis and the administration of atracurium suggest that the patient may have a genetic deficiency in the cholinesterase enzyme that metabolizes succinylcholine, which can cause prolonged muscle paralysis. The administration of neostigmine, which is a cholinesterase inhibitor, will not reverse the paralysis in this case. The patient should be treated with an antidote such as edrophonium or physostigmine, which are cholinesterase reactivators that can reverse the effects of succinylcholine.</s>--------------------------------------------

Question: A 12-year-old boy is brought to the emergency department by ambulance after he was struck by a car while crossing the road. He is found to have a femur fracture and multiple bruises on presentation, but he is alert and hemodynamically stable. He says that the car "came out of nowhere" and that he has had multiple similar near misses in recent months. He has no past medical history but says that he has been having headaches that he describes as dull and continuous. He has also noticed that he has been waking up at night several times to go to the restroom. Otherwise, he has been healthy with no major concerns. A basic metabolic panel shows mild hypernatremia. The most likely pathology underlying this patient's symptoms is derived from which of the following embryonic layers?
The answer is option 1: Endoderm.
The patient's symptoms of headaches and nocturia, along with the finding of mild hypernatremia, suggest that the patient may have a pituitary adenoma. Pituitary adenomas are tumors that arise from the cells of the pituitary gland, which is derived from the endoderm. The pituitary gland is a small endocrine gland located at the base of the brain that plays a crucial role in regulating various bodily functions, including growth, metabolism, and reproduction. Pituitary adenomas are the most common type of pituitary tumor and can be benign or malignant. The patient's history of recurrent near misses with cars and his recent headaches suggest that he may have a pituitary adenoma, which should be further evaluated with imaging studies and a pituitary function test.</s>--------------------------------------------

Options: A:Trauma, B:Chronic steroid use, C:Pott's disease, D:Metastatic lesion, E:Sciatica
Question: A 40-year-old man presents with left hip pain. He says that symptoms started a month ago and have progressively worsened. He says the pain has rendered him unable to report to work for the last 2 weeks. The pain was initially 4/10 in intensity, dull with no radiation and was aggravated to 5/10 in intensity upon weight-bearing. Initially, it improved with rest and Tylenol. He initially attributed it to heavy work and took a few days off work, but he did not seek medical attention. However, it worsened over time to its present 8/10 intensity and does not respond to Tylenol anymore. The patient denies any history of injury, weight loss, change in appetite, or recent travel. His past medical history is significant for Crohn's disease, managed with a combination of prednisone and mesalamine and presently in remission. On physical examination, there is limited flexion and extension at the left hip. The rest of the examination, including a complete neurological examination, is unremarkable. On abdominal imaging of the left hip joint, a transcervical fracture is noted in the left hip with surrounding bony sclerosis. A DEXA scan shows a T-score of  -2.5 at the hips and -1.5 at the lumbar spine (normal T-score ≥ -1.0). Which of the following is most likely to be the underlying cause for the fracture in this patient?
The answer is option 1: Trauma.
Explanation:

1. Trauma: The patient's history of Crohn's disease and the presence of a transcervical fracture in the left hip with surrounding bony sclerosis are consistent with a history of trauma. The patient's history of heavy work and the worsening of symptoms over time suggest that the fracture is related to a recent traumatic event. The patient's low bone density on DEXA scan is also consistent with a history of trauma.
2. Chronic steroid use: The patient's history of Crohn's disease and the use of prednisone and mesalamine to manage the disease are consistent with chronic steroid use. However, the patient's history of heavy work and the worsening of symptoms over time suggest that the fracture is related to a recent traumatic event.
3. Pott's disease: Pott's disease is a chronic infection of the spine that can cause bone destruction and can lead to fractures. The patient's history of Crohn's disease and the presence of a transcervical fracture in the left hip with surrounding bony sclerosis are not consistent with Pott's disease.
4. Metastatic lesion: The patient's history of Crohn's disease and the presence of a transcervical fracture in the left hip with surrounding bony sclerosis are not consistent with a metastatic lesion.
5. Sciatica: The patient's history of Crohn's disease and the presence of a transcervical fracture in the left hip with surrounding bony sclerosis are not consistent with sciatica.

This case highlights the importance of a thorough history and physical examination in making a diagnosis. The patient's history of Crohn's disease and the presence of a transcervical fracture in the left hip with surrounding bony sclerosis are consistent with a history of trauma. The patient's history of heavy work and the worsening of symptoms over time suggest that the fracture is related to a recent traumatic event. The patient's low bone density on DEXA scan is also consistent with a history of trauma.</s>--------------------------------------------

Question: A 78-year-old woman with a history of breast cancer, status-post bilateral mastectomy, presents to the emergency department with progressive difficulty breathing, worsening fatigue, and 5 pounds of unintended weight loss over the past month. A portable chest x-ray reveals a massive right pleural effusion. The ED resident performs thoracentesis with chest tube placement and admits her to the floor. Overnight, the patient requests multiple pain medications for right upper abdominal pain and is found to have increasingly sanguinous drainage. Where was the thoracentesis needle most likely placed?
The answer is option 1: A:Lower border of the 10th rib at the right midaxillary line.
The patient's symptoms and history of breast cancer, as well as the location of the chest x-ray findings, suggest a pleural effusion. The location of the chest x-ray findings is most likely the lower border of the 10th rib at the right midaxillary line, which is the most common site for a pleural effusion. The patient's symptoms of right upper abdominal pain and sanguinous drainage from the chest tube suggest that the chest tube was placed in the right pleural space, which is the most common site for a chest tube placement in a pleural effusion.

Question: A 70-year-old man presents to a physician’s office with shortness of breath for 1 month. He is “easily winded” and is unable to keep up with his grandchildren when playing in the park. Over the last few weeks, he had to increase the number of pillows under his head to sleep comfortably. He denies a cough and fever. The medical history includes hypercholesterolemia and hypertension. His current medications are aspirin, carvedilol, and rosuvastatin. The vital signs are as follows: blood pressure 150/90 mm Hg, pulse 90/min, and respiratory rate 14/min. The physical examination reveals distended jugular veins, bilateral pitting edema of the lower limbs, and fine crackles at the base of the lungs. An echocardiogram reveals an ejection fraction of 40%. Inhibition of which of the following hormones would be most beneficial for this patient?
The answer is option ​D: Epinephrine.
Explanation: This patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are consistent with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF). The patient's distended jugular veins, bilateral pitting edema, and fine crackles on chest X-ray suggest fluid accumulation in the lungs, which is a hallmark of heart failure. The patient's low ejection fraction (40%) on echocardiogram confirms the diagnosis of HFrEF.
Epinephrine is a hormone that increases the heart rate, contractility, and blood pressure. It is a catecholamine that is released from the adrenal gland in response to stress or low blood pressure. In heart failure, epinephrine levels are low, and the heart is unable to respond to the hormone, leading to poor cardiac output and fluid accumulation. Inhibition of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) is a common treatment for heart failure, as it helps to reduce fluid accumulation and improve cardiac function. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE inhibitors) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) are commonly used to inhibit the RAAS.
Option A: Angiotensin II is a hormone that increases blood pressure by constricting blood vessels. It is not beneficial in heart failure.
Option B: Prostaglandin E1 is a hormone that is involved in inflammation and pain. It is not related to heart failure.
Option C: Aldosterone is a hormone that regulates electrolyte balance and blood pressure. It is not related to heart failure.
Option E: Antidiuretic hormone (ADH) is a hormone that regulates water balance in the body. It is not related to heart failure.
Option D: Epinephrine is a hormone that increases the heart rate, contractility, and blood pressure. It is beneficial in heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) by improving cardiac output and reducing fluid accumulation.</s>--------------------------------------------

Question: A 51-year-old man comes to the physician because of severe pain while urinating for 4 days. He has also had to urinate more often than usual. Three weeks ago, he underwent surgery for an incarcerated hernia. While recovering, he developed septic shock and was treated in the intensive care unit. He was discharged 6 days ago. He has a history of hypertension. Current medications include amlodipine and oxycodone. He appears anxious. His temperature is 37.8°C (100°F), pulse is 96/min, and blood pressure is 122/80 mm Hg. Examination shows tenderness to palpation in the suprapubic area; no guarding is present. There is a well-healed surgical scar in the right inguinal region. There is no costovertebral angle tenderness. Urinalysis shows:
Blood 1+
Protein 1+
Nitrite positive
Leukocyte esterase positive
RBC 1–2/hpf
WBC 20–25/hpf
Which of the following would have most likely prevented this complication?"
The answer is option 1: Intermittent catheterization.
This patient has a urinary tract infection (UTI) caused by a bacterial infection. The symptoms of severe pain while urinating and increased frequency of urination, along with the presence of blood, protein, nitrite, leukocyte esterase, and red blood cells in the urine, are consistent with a UTI. The patient's history of surgery and recent hospitalization for septic shock increases the risk of developing a UTI.
Option A: Intermittent catheterization, is the most likely preventative measure in this case. Intermittent catheterization is a method of bladder drainage that involves inserting a catheter into the bladder through the urethra and removing the urine from the bladder. This can help to prevent bacterial colonization of the urinary tract and reduce the risk of UTIs.
Option B: Prophylactic oral ciprofloxacin, is not appropriate in this case as the patient has a UTI and ciprofloxacin is an antibiotic that is effective against gram-negative bacteria, which are not the causative organisms in this case.
Option C: Topical mupirocin application, is not appropriate in this case as the patient has a UTI and mupirocin is an antibiotic that is effective against staphylococci, which are not the causative organisms in this case.
Option D: Use of a hydrophilic catheter, is not appropriate in this case as the patient has a UTI and hydrophilic catheters are not recommended for patients with UTIs.
Option E: Screening for bacteriuria, is not appropriate in this case as the patient has a UTI and bacteriuria is already present.</s>--------------------------------------------

Question: A 27-year-old woman is brought to the physician after passing out at home. Her husband reports that she suddenly lost consciousness for approximately 30 seconds while shoveling snow in the driveway. Immediately before the episode, she felt light-headed and short of breath. Two months ago, she experienced a similar episode while running in her yard with her children. She has no history of serious illness. Her father died of sudden cardiac death at the age of 44 years. Vital signs are within normal limits. Cardiac examination shows a systolic ejection murmur best heard along the left sternal border that decreases with hand grip. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate treatment for this patient?
The answer is option ​D: Cardiac pacemaker.
This patient has symptoms of syncope, which is a loss of consciousness that may be caused by a variety of factors, including cardiac causes. The patient's history of similar episodes, her family history of sudden cardiac death, and the presence of a systolic ejection murmur suggest that she may have a heart condition that is causing her to faint.
The most appropriate treatment for this patient would be a cardiac pacemaker. A pacemaker is a small device that is implanted in the chest to help regulate the heart's rhythm. It works by sending electrical signals to the heart to help it beat properly. This can be helpful in patients with a condition called bradycardia, which is a slow heart rate that can cause symptoms such as dizziness, fatigue, and fainting.
Option A: Septal myectomy is a surgical procedure that is used to treat hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, which is a condition in which the heart muscle becomes thick and enlarged. This procedure involves removing a portion of the thickened muscle to improve blood flow and reduce the risk of sudden death.
Option B: Verapamil is a medication that is used to treat hypertension and angina pectoris. It is a calcium channel blocker that works by relaxing the smooth muscle in the walls of the blood vessels, which can help to lower blood pressure and improve blood flow.
Option C: Amlodipine is another medication that is used to treat hypertension and angina pectoris. It is a calcium channel blocker that works by relaxing the smooth muscle in the walls of the blood vessels, which can help to lower blood pressure and improve blood flow.
Option E: Metoprolol is a medication that is used to treat hypertension and angina pectoris. It is a beta-blocker that works by blocking the action of certain natural chemicals in the body that can cause the heart to beat faster and with less force.

He is at the 20th percentile for height and 3rd percentile for weight. Physical examination shows an enlarged tongue. Crackles are heard at both lung bases. The liver is palpated 1 cm below the right costal margin. Neurologic examination shows decreased muscle tone in the extremities. Serum glucose is 105 mg/dL. An x-ray of the chest shows cardiomegaly. The patient most likely has a deficiency of which of the following enzymes?
The answer is option 1: Acid maltase.
Explanation: The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are consistent with a diagnosis of Pompe disease, which is a lysosomal storage disorder caused by a deficiency of acid alpha-glucosidase (acid maltase). The patient's difficulty feeding, weakness, fatigue, and enlarged tongue are consistent with the muscle and respiratory involvement seen in Pompe disease. The cardiomegaly and decreased muscle tone in the extremities are also consistent with the disease. The patient's low serum glucose level is also consistent with the disease. The x-ray of the chest shows cardiomegaly, which is a common finding in Pompe disease.
Option A: Acid maltase is the enzyme that is deficient in Pompe disease.
Option B: Myophosphorylase is not involved in Pompe disease.

Question: A 43-year-old man presents to a medical office for follow-up of hypertension. He was recently diagnosed and has been managing his condition with diet modification and moderate-intensity exercise. Today, he brings a list of his recent at-home morning blood pressure readings. The systolic blood pressure readings over the last 5 days are as follows:
Day 1: 130 mm Hg
Day 2: 132 mm Hg
Day 3: 128 mm Hg
Day 4: 132 mm Hg
Day 5: 128 mm Hg
What is the standard deviation for the systolic blood pressure readings?
The answer is option 1.
The standard deviation is a measure of the spread or dispersion of a set of data. It is calculated by taking the square root of the variance. In this case, the variance is calculated by taking the sum of the squared deviations from the mean and dividing by the number of observations minus 1.
The variance for the systolic blood pressure readings is:
(130-128)^2 + (132-128)^2 + (128-128)^2 + (132-128)^2 + (128-128)^2
= 4 + 4 + 0 + 4 + 4
= 16
The standard deviation is the square root of the variance, so the standard deviation for the systolic blood pressure readings is:
sqrt(16)
= 4.0 mm Hg
Therefore, the standard deviation for the systolic blood pressure readings is 4.0 mm Hg.</s>--------------------------------------------

Question: An 11-year-old boy is brought to the physician by his mother because of worsening fatigue. His mother reports that he seems to have trouble keeping up with his older brothers when playing outside. Physical examination shows conjunctival pallor. A hemoglobin electrophoresis is performed. This patient's results are shown in comparison to those of a patient with known sickle cell anemia and a child with normal hemoglobin. Based on this electrophoresis, which of the following types of hemoglobin are dominant in this patient's blood?
The answer is option 1: HbA and HbC.
Hemoglobin electrophoresis is a laboratory test that separates different types of hemoglobin in the blood based on their charge and size. The test is used to diagnose and monitor various types of hemoglobinopathies, such as sickle cell disease, thalassemia, and other inherited blood disorders.
In this case, the patient's results show that the most dominant hemoglobin is HbA, followed by HbC. This suggests that the patient has a heterozygous genotype for sickle cell disease, which is characterized by the presence of both HbS and HbA in the blood. HbC is a type of hemoglobin that is found in some individuals with sickle cell disease.
The patient's symptoms of fatigue and conjunctival pallor, along with the results of the hemoglobin electrophoresis, support the diagnosis of sickle cell disease.</s>--------------------------------------------

Options: A:Aortic dissection, B:Hypertensive urgency, C:Hypertensive emergency, D:Aortic aneurysm, E:Malignant hypertension
Question: A 55-year-old African American man presents to the emergency department with central chest pressure. His symptoms started 1 day before. The pain was initially intermittent in nature but has become constant and radiates to his jaw and left shoulder. He also complains of some difficulty breathing. The patient was diagnosed with essential hypertension 1 year ago, but he is not taking any medications for it. The patient denies smoking, alcohol, or drug use. Family history is unremarkable. His blood pressure is 230/130 mm Hg in both arms, the temperature is 36.9°C (98.4°F), and the pulse is 90/min. ECG shows diffuse T wave inversion and ST depression in lateral leads. Laboratory testing is significant for elevated troponin. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?
The answer is option ​D: Aortic aneurysm.
Aortic dissection is a tear in the inner lining of the aorta, which allows blood to flow between the layers of the aortic wall. This can cause severe pain, often described as a tearing or ripping sensation, and can be accompanied by other symptoms such as back pain, nausea, and vomiting. The pain is usually constant and severe, and it may radiate to the back, neck, or shoulders. Hypertensive urgency and hypertensive emergency are not the most likely diagnosis in this case, as the patient has not been taking his blood pressure medication and his blood pressure is very high. Malignant hypertension is a rare but serious complication of hypertension that can cause damage to various organs, including the kidneys, eyes, and brain. Aortic aneurysm is another possible diagnosis, as the patient's ECG shows diffuse T wave inversion and ST depression in lateral leads, which can be indicative of ischemia caused by atherosclerosis. However, aortic aneurysm is less likely than aortic dissection in this case, as the patient's blood pressure is very high and the ECG findings are not consistent with aortic aneurysm.
Option A: Aortic dissection is the most likely diagnosis in this case. The patient's symptoms, including the location and character of the chest pain, the elevated blood pressure, and the ECG findings, are all consistent with aortic dissection. The patient's history of essential hypertension and the fact that he is not taking his medication also support this diagnosis.
Option B: Hypertensive urgency and hypertensive emergency are not the most likely diagnosis in this case, as the patient has not been taking his blood pressure medication and his blood pressure is very high.
Option C: Malignant hypertension is a rare but serious complication of hypertension that can cause damage to various organs, including the kidneys, eyes, and brain. However, it is less likely than aortic dissection in this case, as the patient's blood pressure is very high and the ECG findings are not consistent with malignant hypertension.
Option E: Aortic aneurysm is another possible diagnosis, as the patient's ECG shows diffuse T wave inversion and ST depression in lateral leads, which can be indicative of ischemia caused by atherosclerosis.

Options: A:Positive GM1 ganglioside autoantibodies, B:Positive Lyme ELISA test, C:Low vitamin B12 level, D:Elevated TSH and decreased FT4 levels, E:Elevated HbA1c level
Question: A 38-year-old woman comes to the physician for the evaluation of progressive weakness and numbness for 3 months. The symptoms started in her lower legs and gradually moved to her upper legs and arms. During the last 5 days, she has also had bilateral facial weakness with headaches. She has hepatitis B and Graves' disease. She is sexually active with one male partner and they use condoms inconsistently. Her current medications include methimazole and a multivitamin. Vital signs are within normal limits. She is alert and fully oriented. She has bilateral upper and lower facial paralysis. There is generalized weakness of the muscles. Sensation to light touch is decreased throughout and is absent in her fingertips and toes. Deep tendon reflexes are 1+ bilaterally. Further evaluation of this patient is most likely to show which of the following findings?
The answer is option ​D: Elevated TSH and decreased FT4 levels.
This patient's symptoms of progressive weakness, numbness, and bilateral facial weakness with headaches, along with the physical examination findings of generalized weakness, decreased sensation, and bilateral upper and lower facial paralysis, suggest a diagnosis of myasthenia gravis. Myasthenia gravis is an autoimmune disorder that causes weakness of the skeletal muscles. The most common form of myasthenia gravis is generalized, which affects the muscles of the face, arms, and legs. The patient's history of hepatitis B and Graves' disease, and her inconsistent use of condoms, may increase her risk of developing myasthenia gravis.
The laboratory findings that would be most helpful in making the diagnosis of myasthenia gravis include elevated TSH and decreased FT4 levels. Elevated TSH and decreased FT4 levels are seen in about 80% of patients with myasthenia gravis. This is due to the autoantibodies that are present in the disorder, which bind to the receptors for acetylcholine at the neuromuscular junction, leading to muscle weakness.
The other options listed are not specific to myasthenia gravis and are not likely to be present in this patient. Positive GM1 ganglioside autoantibodies are not specific to myasthenia gravis and are not likely to be present in this patient. Positive Lyme ELISA test is not specific to myasthenia gravis and is not likely to be present in this patient. Low vitamin B12 level is not specific to myasthenia gravis and is not likely to be present in this patient. Elevated HbA1c level is not specific to myasthenia gravis and is not likely to be present in this patient.</s>--------------------------------------------

Options: A:Hepatitis A, B:Hepatitis B, C:Hepatitis C, D:Hepatitis D, E:Hepatitis E
Question: A 32-year-old G2P1 at 32 weeks gestation presents to the emergency department with complaints of severe abdominal pain, fatigue, and nausea. Physical examination is significant for profound jaundice and tenderness to palpation of the right upper quadrant of the abdomen. The patient returned 2 weeks ago from a 1 month-long trip to India. She received sporadic pre-natal care while traveling and reports no known complications in her current pregnancy to date. She denies any past medical problems and states that her prior pregnancy proceeded as a normal vaginal birth without any complications. Infection with which of the following organisms would portend the worst prognosis with the highest mortality rate for this patient?
The answer is option 1: Hepatitis A.
Hepatitis A is a viral infection that primarily affects the liver and is transmitted through contaminated food and water, as well as close personal contact. It is usually self-limiting, but can cause severe illness in pregnant women, particularly in the third trimester. The mortality rate for hepatitis A in pregnant women is low, but the risk of fulminant hepatitis and death is higher in this population.
Hepatitis B is a viral infection that primarily affects the liver and is transmitted through blood, semen, and other bodily fluids. It can cause chronic infection and can be transmitted to the fetus during delivery.
Hepatitis C is a viral infection that primarily affects the liver and is transmitted through blood-to-blood contact. It can cause chronic infection and can be transmitted to the fetus during delivery.
Hepatitis D is a viral infection that only affects individuals who are already infected with hepatitis B virus. It is transmitted through blood-to-blood contact and can cause severe liver disease.
Hepatitis E is a viral infection that primarily affects the liver and is transmitted through contaminated food and water. It is usually self-limiting, but can cause severe illness in pregnant women, particularly in the third trimester.
The patient's symptoms of severe abdominal pain, fatigue, and nausea, along with her recent travel history and lack of prenatal care, suggest a diagnosis of hepatitis A. The patient's history of a prior normal vaginal birth also suggests that she is not at high risk for fulminant hepatitis. However, given the severity of her symptoms, she should be hospitalized and closely monitored for complications.</s>--------------------------------------------

Options: A:There is a significant correlation between the daily fiber intake and the frequency of coronary heart incidents because the correlation coefficient is significant., B:There is a significant correlation between fiber intake and the frequency of coronary heart incidents because the correlation coefficient is not significant., C:There is a significant correlation between fiber intake and the frequency of coronary heart incidents because the value of the correlation coefficient shows a very good and robust correlation., D:There is no correlation between fiber intake and the frequency of coronary heart incidents because the correlation coefficient is significant., E:There is no correlation between fiber intake and the frequency of coronary heart incidents because the correlation coefficient is not significant.
Question: A group of researchers is conducting a prospective study to examine if dietary fiber intake is protective against coronary heart disease. Specifically, they are looking at the frequency of coronary heart incidents in a group of middle-aged men taking various daily amounts of water-insoluble fiber. The Pearson correlation coefficient that was obtained regarding the relationship between the amount of daily water-insoluble fiber intake and the frequency of coronary heart incidents in their study was 0.11 with a p-value of 0.006. Which of the following statements is correct regarding this study result?
The answer is option 1.

Explanation:

The Pearson correlation coefficient measures the linear relationship between two variables. A correlation coefficient of 0.11 indicates a weak positive correlation, meaning that as the amount of water-insoluble fiber intake increases, the frequency of coronary heart incidents also increases, but the relationship is not strong.

The p-value of 0.006 indicates that the correlation is statistically significant at the 0.05 level, which means that there is less than a 5% chance that the observed correlation is due to chance.

Therefore, the correct statement is that the study result suggests a weak positive correlation between the amount of daily water-insoluble fiber intake and the frequency of coronary heart incidents.

Question: A 24-year-old man comes to the physician because of a painful swelling above his buttocks for 1 week. He is unable to sit for extended periods because of the pain. He has obstructive sleep apnea and type 2 diabetes mellitus. His only medication is metformin. He appears anxious. He is 175 cm (5 ft 9 in) tall and weighs 114 kg (251 lb); BMI is 37 kg/m2. His temperature is 38.1°C (100.6°F), pulse is 96/min and blood pressure is 124/86 mm Hg. Examination shows facial acne. A cyst is seen above the natal cleft. There is tenderness to palpation at the cyst and surrounding tissue. The skin around the cyst is warm and erythematous. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
The answer is option ​D:Retinoid therapy.
This patient presents with a painful swelling above the natal cleft, which is likely a coccyx cyst. The patient's history of obstructive sleep apnea and type 2 diabetes mellitus, along with his BMI of 37 kg/m2, suggest that he may have a condition called acne inversa. This is a rare, chronic, and often recurrent condition characterized by cysts and abscesses in the skin folds of the buttocks, genital area, and perineum. The cysts are often caused by a blockage of the sebaceous glands in the skin.
The most appropriate next step in management for this patient would be to refer him to a dermatologist for further evaluation and management. The dermatologist may recommend retinoid therapy, which is a topical medication that can help to reduce the size of the cysts and abscesses. Other treatment options may include incision and drainage, surgical resection and primary wound closure, or coccygectomy.
It is important to note that the patient's anxiety and obesity should be addressed as part of his overall management.</s>--------------------------------------------

Question: A 62-year-old man presents to his primary care provider complaining of abdominal pain. He reports a 6-month history of gradually progressive epigastric pain and 10 pounds of unexpected weight loss. He has also noticed that his skin feels itchier than usual. His past medical history is notable for gout, hypertension, and diabetes mellitus. He takes allopurinol, enalapril, and glyburide. He has a 10-pack-year smoking history and a distant history of cocaine abuse. His temperature is 100.1°F (37.8°C), blood pressure is 135/85 mmHg, pulse is 100/min, and respirations are 20/min. On exam, he has notable hepatomegaly and a palpable gallbladder. A right upper quadrant ultrasound reveals an irregular extrahepatic mass originating from the gallbladder wall. Which of the following serum markers is most likely elevated in this patient?
The answer is option ​D: S-100.
S-100 protein is a calcium-binding protein that is expressed in many normal tissues, including the pancreas, salivary glands, and sweat glands. It is also expressed in some neuroendocrine tumors, including carcinoid tumors. Carcinoid tumors are rare, but they can cause a variety of symptoms, including flushing, diarrhea, and wheezing. They can also cause weight loss, abdominal pain, and skin itching. The diagnosis of carcinoid tumor is confirmed by the finding of elevated serum levels of the biomarker S-100 protein.
Bombesin is a neuropeptide that is expressed in the gastrointestinal tract and the respiratory system. It can cause symptoms such as diarrhea, abdominal pain, and flushing. It is not specific for any particular type of cancer.
CA-125 is a glycoprotein that is expressed in the ovaries and other normal tissues. It is used as a marker for ovarian cancer, but it can also be elevated in other types of cancer, as well as in benign conditions such as endometriosis.
CA 19-9 is a glycoprotein that is expressed in the pancreas, biliary tract, and gastrointestinal tract. It is used as a marker for pancreatic and biliary tract cancer, but it can also be elevated in other types of cancer, as well as in benign conditions such as chronic pancreatitis.
Tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) is an enzyme that is expressed in osteoclasts. It is used as a marker for bone tumors, such as osteosarcoma.
Based on the patient's symptoms and the finding of an irregular extrahepatic mass originating from the gallbladder wall on ultrasound, the most likely diagnosis is a carcinoid tumor. The elevated serum levels of S-100 protein would support this diagnosis.</s>--------------------------------------------

The answer is option 1: Parvovirus B19.
This patient's symptoms of fatigue, palpitations, and shortness of breath, along with the laboratory findings of anemia, microcytic anemia, and low reticulocyte count, are consistent with parvovirus B19 infection. Parvovirus B19 is a common cause of aplastic anemia and other hematologic disorders in patients with sickle cell disease. The patient's sickle cell disease increases the risk of developing parvovirus B19 infection. The patient's midsystolic ejection murmur is also consistent with the underlying cardiac involvement that can occur with parvovirus B19 infection.
Option A: Parvovirus B19 is the most likely underlying cause of these findings.
Option B: Medication-induced hemolysis is less likely as the patient is on hydroxyurea and folic acid which are used to treat sickle cell disease and are not known to cause hemolysis.
Option C: Defect in erythrocyte membrane proteins is less likely as the patient's microcytic anemia is not caused by a defect in erythrocyte membrane proteins.
Option D: Splenic vaso-occlusion is a complication of sickle cell disease and can cause anemia, but it is not the most likely cause of the patient's current symptoms.

For the past 6 months, she has also had increased shortness of breath, palpitations, and chest tightness that resolves with rest. She immigrated with her family from India 10 years ago. Pulse is 115/min and irregular and blood pressure is 108/70 mm Hg. Cardiac examination shows an accentuated and split S2. There is an opening snap followed by a low-pitched diastolic murmur in the fifth left intercostal space at the midclavicular line. An ECG shows atrial fibrillation and right axis deviation. Which of the following is the most likely underlying mechanism of these findings?
The answer is option 1: A: Increased pulmonary capillary wedge pressure.
Explanation: The patient's symptoms of loss of consciousness, palpitations, and chest tightness that resolve with rest, along with the physical examination findings of an accentuated and split S2, an opening snap followed by a low-pitched diastolic murmur in the fifth left intercostal space at the midclavicular line, and an ECG showing atrial fibrillation and right axis deviation, are consistent with a diagnosis of mitral stenosis. Mitral stenosis is a condition in which the mitral valve becomes narrowed, obstructing blood flow from the left ventricle to the left atrium. This can lead to increased pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, which can cause symptoms such as dizziness, palpitations, and shortness of breath. The patient's immigrant status and the fact that she has had symptoms for 6 months suggest that this is the most likely underlying mechanism of her symptoms.
Option B: Increased central venous pressure is less likely as the patient's blood pressure is normal.
Option C: Increased oxygenated blood in the right ventricle is less likely as the patient's ECG shows atrial fibrillation and right axis deviation.
Option D: Increased mean arterial pressure is less likely as the patient's blood pressure is normal.

The answer is option ​D: Clopidogrel: antagonizes ADP receptors on endothelial cells.
Clopidogrel is a thienopyridine drug that is used to prevent cardiovascular events such as myocardial infarction and stroke. It works by blocking the ADP receptors on endothelial cells, which reduces the formation of thrombus. This drug is commonly used in patients with acute coronary syndrome, and it is often used in combination with aspirin. Clopidogrel is not an anticoagulant or an antiplatelet drug, but it is an inhibitor of platelet aggregation.
Warfarin, heparin, aspirin, clopidogrel, prasugrel, and ticagrelor are all antiplatelet and anticoagulant drugs. Warfarin and heparin are anticoagulants, while aspirin, clopidogrel, prasugrel, and ticagrelor are all antiplatelet drugs. Warfarin directly inhibits thrombin, heparin activates antithrombin 3, aspirin reversibly inhibits COX-1, clopidogrel antagonizes ADP receptors on endothelial cells, prasugrel has a reduced risk of bleeding compared to other drugs in its class, and ticagrelor is a reversible adenosine diphosphate (ADP) receptor antagonist.</s>
